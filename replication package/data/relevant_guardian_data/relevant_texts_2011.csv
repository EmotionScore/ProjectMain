mps discussed sex discrimination yesterday as recent events at sky sports have demonstrated this is a tricky topic watching anyone address it reminds me of someone walking barefoot across eggshells watching mps doing so is reminiscent of hippos linedancing on champagne flutes it has to be done with immense care and the knowledge that one false step could make things go horribly wrong theresa may who as well as home secretary is minister for women and equalities is adept at this for example john glen of salisbury a tory put it to her that women were more likely to get on to the boards of corporations in the united states where there are very few regulations than in places such as scandinavia where there are all sorts of rules about parental leave that sounded like a heffalump trap but mrs may placed her faux leopardskin shoes deftly on either side she thanked mr glen for pointing out the varied methods used around the world to help women get to the top she also pointed out that the government had appointed lord davies to see how obstacles to womens progress could be removed labours denis macshane asked her to confirm that this great panjandrum lord davies who is going to get more women on to boards is a man the home secretary wasnt going to be fooled by that cunning poser her answer in its entirety was yes then dominic raab was on his feet mr raab is loathed by almost all the labour women in the place and some tories too for claiming this week that men were the victims of flagrant discrimination in the workplace they worked longer hours and were in greater danger of losing their jobs i dont know what ambitions mr raab still nurses but they cannot include becoming a football commentator mrs may replied crisply that the law banned discrimination against men as well as women adding from her brief the answer i have here is sex at work but i think it means on the basis of gender a civil servant from the department assigned to keep an eye on question time could be seen burying his head in his hands mr raab asked mildly enough if making parental leave transferable would help eliminate antimale discrimination in the workplace the home secretary was enthusiastic we should try to get away from gender warfare and the politics of difference she said but i suggest to my hon friend that labelling feminists as obnoxious bigots is not the way forward at this the labour frontbench all but one of them women gave a mighty cheer the sexist pig had been routed by his own side and i bet he doesnt understand the offside rule,2011-01,mp discussed sex discrimination

in the week when sky presenter andy gray has been sacked for unacceptable behaviour feminism may have gone far enough at least thats what conservative mp dominic raab thinks he has defended his comment that men get a raw deal at work because of feminist bigots being unreasonable on issues such as equal pay along with many conservative thinkers raab appears to believe in an invisible set of magic scales whereby if life improves for women it automatically gets worse for men as if there were a finite amount of social justice in the world its a neat little story but the truth is more complicated myth feminist bigots have made mens lives worse it is certainly the case that over the past years the working life of the average man has become more stressful more precarious and more cowed but this is largely because of the erosion of employment rights and conditions as successive governments have set out to break the power of organised labour women and immigrants have often been used as scapegoats when life gets harder for workers governments find it easier to manipulate public prejudice than blame themselves in recent years both men and women have found that their working hours have increased while their wages and job security have dipped and that has everything to do with poor economic stewardship and nothing to do with feminism myth men work harder longer hours than women men do work longer hours in many industries but only if you subscribe to the view that paid work is the only work that counts womens unpaid caring childrearing and domestic labour contributes tens of billions of pounds to this economy and years after the equal pay act womens share of the domestic load remains close to double that of men raab talks as if women who choose to work flexible hours shorter hours or parttime contracts do so in order to sit at home painting their nails and gobbling chocolate in fact most women use that extra time to care for dependants and do often tedious domestic work myth equality legislation is antimen as the gray and keys incident illustrated this week sexism is still alive in the workplace very few men complain of gender discrimination at work the vast majority of the thousands of complaints about sexual harassment unfair pay differentials and exclusion from decisionmaking that the equal opportunities commission receives every year are made by women on top of this about working women are sacked or made redundant each year when they fall pregnant does raab truly believe that preventing pregnant workers from being fired and protecting women from sexual harassment is unfair on men myth equality legislation is antifamily when conservatives vow to protect the family they are often talking about a specific understanding of the nuclear family a married heterosexual couple with children where the man contributes most of the household income back in real life there have always been singleparent families and families who cannot afford for one adult to exempt themselves from paid employment it is these families whose situations improve when women are fairly paid have secure jobs and are able to balance their commitments between home and employment if the stated policy of the conservative party is that strong and stable families of all kinds are the bedrock of a strong and stable society they should be promoting the equality legislation that protects these advances one truth we need to end the gender war raab is absolutely correct to suggest that many are fed up of men and women being pitted against each other in an outdated battle of the sexes unfortunately his insistence that working mens problems are the fault of feminism seems set to stir up yet more bitterness between men and women in the workplace a classic strategy of divide and rule convincing ordinary people that women are making gains at the expense of men or vice versa distracts us all from the truth that more than ever under this governments austerity programme it is the rich who are making gains at the expense of the poor true feminism seeks not to make women the equals of men within an exploitative system but to liberate both sexes from oppression,2011-01,week sky presenter andy gray ha sacked unacceptable behaviour feminism may gone far enough least thats conservative mp dominic raab think ha defended comment men get raw deal work

on a train from brighton to london i check my appearance wondering if my gender will complicate matters at my destination the den home of millwall fc and their notorious supporters football widely seen in england but not the usa or australia for example as the last bastion of unreconstructed masculinity is the final sphere of my life in which i began to present as female largely because transitioning involved not just altering my body but rethinking all received ideas about gender as i said in my first column my earliest consciousness of the role that gender plays in socialising came at primary school when a friend said that i had to become more masculine then as now this seemed absurd i ignored it until a few years later when i realised my desire to transition now i know that my fundamental transsexual impulse and my disdain for stereotypically masculine traits are separate concerns but their relationship has been complicated and managing my assigned gender before starting the real life experience was if anything harder than dealing with the varied responses to my living as female plenty of maletofemale transsexual narratives describe a pretransitional flight into hypermasculinity as they tried and failed to repress their gender identities this was never the case for me male testosterone levels alone arent enough to explain typically masculine behaviour and at school i always felt uncomfortable around louder more aggressive boys i didnt really know what it meant to be masculine beyond liking the holy trinity of cars girls and football but i knew what it wasnt because inappropriate behaviour was rigorously policed my strongest memory is of sitting crosslegged before someone yelled you sit like a queer and i realised just how vigilant some teenage boys could be against even the tiniest gender transgressions after leaving school i thought differently about how i managed my gender resolving to just be myself whatever combination of masculine and feminine behaviours that entailed in my early twenties i enjoyed being androgynous when it felt safe id read too many media reports that offered men the transsexual panic defence after inflicting violence on trans women what pleased me most even then was being read as female i remember walking around brighton with long hair and makeup when a young man swaggered up to me and said thats a birds coat mate i walked past relieved as his female companion told him that is a bird you muppet a pretransitional moment that made me realise that although playing with my gender presentation might be risky at times it could also be fun and funny so as i became an adult i wasnt too bothered about how my behaviour fitted other peoples expectations having acted on my transitional desire this still feels true im aware that having been socialised as male has strongly influenced my interests and social circles having lived as female for nearly two years i see no reason to alter my tastes or break any friendships i thought my existing relationship dynamics within groups of male friends may change but they havent really partly because i was open about my transgenderism long before i came out as transsexual but also i generalise for two other reasons firstly many display acceptance by not treating me differently i recall one seeing me as juliet for the first time pausing momentarily and then saying i see norwich sacked nigel worthington secondly as a trans man speculated to me recently many men will only change their behaviour around a woman if they fancy her while i want my friends to respect my identity and gender me accordingly im not quite that demanding getting over that deeply ingrained fear of more aggressive men has taken a while especially as its always males who hurl abuse at me in the street for a short while after beginning transition i femmed down for football matches unwilling to stop doing something i loved but afraid that the gender regulation i still encounter might move from taunts to violence if i dressed too conspicuously in the wrong context all for a third division draw on a wet november afternoon in southampton entering the away end without hassle i take my seat just a few places away from one of my heroes and just enjoy the match at least until the end of the second half when millwall striker john marquis equalises after four minutes of injury time on the plus side i reflect it should placate the home crowd sure enough the short journey back to london bridge on a train packed with millwall supporters is incidentfree i go to a pub with a friend reflecting on how the majority of millwalls fans are boisterous something perpetuated by their reputation but essentially good natured and that the atmosphere they create is often preferable to the stony silence of many other stadiums then i hear that another friends elevenyearold daughter has been hit by a coin mindlessly lobbed at the away fans by a home supporter shes crying apparently and says she never wants to go to a game again i feel sad that this is all it takes to generate such fear but optimistic that in time shell realise that one individuals thoughtlessness however reprehensible should not dominate her view of any group nor stop her doing anything she wants juliet jacquess column appears fortnightly you are invited to post comments and questions for juliet below

its no secret that the world economic forum is maledominated the air is thin in davos and every january it gets saturated with testosterone as economic and business leaders swoop in for the annual meeting momentarily replacing the resort towns sea of ski parkas with a cloud of black suits but we didnt know how bad things were until it was reported that sponsors of the meeting have been told to make sure they bring one woman for every four men in their delegation i couldnt believe this would be considered an improvement until i read that female attendance has stood at around for the last few years at least they are being realistic said one businessman who has been going to davos for years of course the likes of the daily telegraph weighed in by complaining that political correctness has made it all the way to the swiss alpine peaks yet the move seems unlikely to be due to any newfound appreciation of women speculation is rife as to the reasons for the new policy some optimists believe the wife of klaus schwab chairman and founder of the world economic forum has finally intervened after years but another darker reason is being discussed apparently last year in a costcutting move strategic partners who pay much of the cost of davos were told to pare their delegations down from five to four people the partners refused but they were then told that if they were going to bring more than four people the fifth would have to be a woman this of course does not mean davos will have women the delegations of the strategic partners are only a part of the entire delegation if you want to defend the world economic forum as many do you could point that there are very few women in the world of finance and among ceos so its hardly wefs fault that so few come to davos there are some we see almost every year chrystia freeland the former editor of the financial times time magazine assistant managing editor rana forohoor economists laura tyson and abby joseph cohen and pepsico president indra nooy overall though women at davos do feel overlooked granted everyone at davos regardless of gender feels slighted at davos thats part of its charm illustrating the difficulties of pulling off a meeting of people all of whom think they are very important virtually everyone leaves davos convinced that they were given the room with the worst view or were put on the dullest panel and that the really important dinner was somewhere else and that they were not invited and of course there are many other complaints about davos that its an evil cabal of businessmen intending to destroy the world that it doesnt pay enough attention to the really pressing issues of our day poverty climate change and that the food is lousy so on the plane ride over everyone from ceos to their assistants puffs up their attitude and by the time they hit baggage claim they are all wound up for women its just a little worse because there are so few of us it gets discussed all the time but rarely publicly if being a davos woman is hard being a davos wife is still more invidious davos wives are given white nameonly badges with no affiliation which is like an announcement to the world that no one need trouble talking to us we are given last priority to get into sessions and sometimes barred from the popular ones and no matter how accomplished we are in our own right we are never given a chance to participate just about the only activity organised specifically for davos wives is a sleigh ride to a fondue restaurant which admittedly is really fun but all in all no wonder many never bother to come back the next year so if the world economic forum really wants to give women more visibility without spending money on recruiting new ones they could draw on the pool of actually

people think we are childmolesting perverts because of media reporting or pantomime dames figures to ridicule to be pointed out and laughed at regardless of our feelings runs a desperate cry on trans media watch a website offering guidance to journalists on an area which is often misunderstood how to portray transgender issues and people the observer would like to think of itself as reasonably progressive in this area careful to give the correct pronoun to someone who has a gender identity that is different from their biological sex or who has undergone gender reassignment but reaction to coverage of the death of brilliant human rights lawyer david burgess also known as sonia burgess shows that however careful the approach to the story the issue is extremely sensitive earlier this month the new review devoted four pages to a word account of the life and death of this extraordinary person last october sonia burgess first identified by her railcard died beneath a tube train at kings cross station it was later discovered that sonia was biologically male a man called david burgess an immigration lawyer of international reputation a murder trial begins next month the observer piece included this sentence many of sonias friends found the media interest difficult to stomach especially as some newspapers used the male pronoun to refer to burgess in spite of the fact that he had chosen to live as a woman this enraged several transgender readers who felt the observer had done just that ignoring sonias chosen identity and referring to her using the male pronoun and identifying her both as david and sonia what youre actually saying is that this person believed themselves to be female and that your policy is to ignore that because you dont believe she was female and therefore you use the male pronoun was a typical reaction from a reader who went on to accuse the paper of transphobia i wrote to that reader after i had spoken to the author of the piece elizabeth day who in my view had gone to great lengths to approach the subject as sensitively as possible i felt that this passage from the piece summed up her dilemma as a writer on the day that burgess was killed he was living as a woman and yet working as a man he was open about his lifestyle to anyone who asked but he also had separate groups of friends those who knew him as david and those who knew him exclusively as sonia he allowed only his closest confidants to see him in both guises this i felt was a simple fact and one that could not be ignored by adhering to the female pronoun i also told readers that the family had asked the observer to refer to burgess as both david and sonia according to the stage in his narrative a point underlined by their own adoption of both male and female pronouns in their funeral eulogies at st martininthefields a service attended by people whose lives had been touched by this deeply compassionate person however members of the transgender community wrote dismissing the wishes of the family it is how sonia wanted to be referred to that is important not other people said one reader the wishes of the family have absolutely no bearing on how this was handled wrote another i disagree too often newspapers are accused of ignoring the wishes of those who have lost loved ones this stubborn insistence that burgess be referred to as she throughout the piece misses the point that he was famed for his sensitivity on the subject of his identity both towards his children from his year marriage and towards his colleagues his firms founding partner said he never came to work as sonia but that i think was more to do with david wanting to make sure everyone else was ok that would be his greatest concern he was always thinking of other people our style guide currently has no entry on transgender issues clearly it needs one but as the experience of the past week has shown its not going to be easy to arrive at a consensus

i thought i would get used to my husbands name but i couldnt said kyoko tsukamoto one of five people launching a lawsuit against the japanese government claiming that the civil law forcing them to take their husbands name after marriage violates their constitutional rights i felt a strong sense of loss growing inside me she explained i picture the white fur that spreads over the underside of a dying leaf japan is the only g nation where it is illegal for a woman to keep her maiden name but sometimes it feels as though britains thumb is hovering over a similar button why do young women who it goes without saying now enter marriage as equals usually replace their surname with their husbands like yearold tsukamoto who divorced her husband in just so she could pull her own name back its a practice that i find at best confusing at worst sinister a quiet reminder that underneath all the modern husbands coparenting and empathetic lactation he is more important than she taking your husbands name is a custom that first spread across britain in the th century without wanting to bore on its worth remembering that this is a custom that stemmed from the idea of women as property with marriage as the contract that transferred women to their husbands from their fathers like a slightly dented ford focus womens legal identities were subsumed into their husbands so there was really no point in them having their own names legally they ceased to exist do most women change their name for the same reason they wear a white dress on their wedding day and deely boppers on their hen night simply because its a tradition passed down by aunts might this japanese case make those planning marriage think twice not just the women but the men often insistent on upholding the convention if only because its easier with her old name alive only as her childrens password reminder in years time over the past decade despite increased gender equality fewer and fewer women have kept their names after marriage there was a record number of name changes in the uk in in america a study saw the number of collegeeducated women in their s who kept their name dropping from in to in and a survey suggested that of brides in their s take their husbands name but could this show not that were becoming more conservative in our views of marriage but that our names are no longer a political issue maybe reminding oneself of the origins of this practice is unhelpful only picking at the scab of sexism maybe today womens independence is so secure that our names are of little import like so many modern and luxurious feminist decisions here there seem to be pools of grey in between the retrosexist blacks and blinding whites in this case the thing that tsukamoto in japan is fighting for and which we in the uk sometimes forget we have is the opportunity to choose zip it sting it will rain if you turn on the telly a friends repeat will be playing on e there are some things one can be sure

anonymity for rape victims following the julian assange extradition case shows ignorance the morality of anonymity january we know no one whos found the protection afforded by anonymity condescending nor does it make rape prosecutions more difficult low reporting about of rapes and low conviction rates result largely from negligent and biased investigations but moore herself is muddled somehow women concerned with the dangers the wikileaks founder faces extradition rendition and even execution because of the effectiveness of wikileaks are losing their heads around assange i picture bianca jagger washing his feet with her tears soon by dismissing jagger moore removes upholding human rights and opposing dictatorships from feminist concern what an indictment of her feminism in this way the nub of the question is avoided rape allegations against assange can no longer be disentangled from the political agenda shaping how they are dealt with hes become an easy target for expressions of fury and frustration at sexism as part of a movement of rape survivors for over years we campaign for justice and protection for rape victims right to anonymity and defendants right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty moore rails against the pitiful results achieved by smiley feminism which fears to be labelled as manhaters she objects to silicone implants shopping and the term sex workers we are all sex workers these days we are all encouraged to pursue lifelong sexiness she says i want a movement and who does she propose pornographyobsessed andrea dworkin batty but she had balls are balls what women need we thought we needed principles sadly they have been scarce moore acknowledges that turning vulnerable young girls into drugaddicted prostitutes is disgusting in any culture but belittles complaints about jack straws racist comments that asian men target vulnerable young white girls arguments about ethnicity and faith are not the central issue she says yet most groomers and rapists in the uk are of course white it is reminiscent of susan brownmillers against our will the feminist antirape bible which was ambivalent on the lynching of yearold emmet till for whistling at a white woman his whistling was just short of physical assault a last reminder that this black boy till had in mind to possess her moore would do better to rail against feminists in government who rarely act for women and often act against us when she says women are suffering most from the cuts that men are making she forgets that yvette coopers welfare cuts insisted that even

there was a time in the early s when i seemed to be on a picket every week one of the best was that against the leeds cinema at which video nasties were being screened the worst of which we feminists argued was i spit on your grave isoyg a raperevengehorror movie depicting the violent sexual torture of a young woman rape is not entertainment we chanted on hearing that the film has been remade and remembering the controversy the original caused i watched the new version with trepidation the director i was assured has given the remake strong feminist overtones it is still truly shocking it shows in detail and at length the gang rape of jennifer a sexually confident young woman from new york city who moves to the country to live in an isolated log cabin while writing a novel local men unappealing rednecks spy on her while she sunbathes in a tiny bikini before capturing humiliating and raping her over and over again eventually jennifer recovers tracks the rapists down onebyone and exacts the most delicious revenge on them one has his penis hacked off and bleeds to death another is garrotted and so on it is nothing if not an exploitation movie why then do i still believe both versions of isoyg to be more feminist albeit in a purely accidental way than the accused the muchlauded film starring jodie foster feminists hailed the accused partly because the story served to debunk a number of pernicious rape myths fosters character sarah is a party animal who dirty dances with a man in a bar and is raped by him and two others over a pinball machine in full view of their cheering mates with the help of a determined prosecution lawyer and a decent man who was in the bar and decides to give evidence the men who cheered the rapists on are convicted amid dramatic courtroom scenes the film is based on a true story but with a somewhat different outcome in a woman was gangraped on a pool table in new bedford massachusetts while onlookers cheered it went to trial amid tales of the victims previous sexual history and rumours of drunkenness the trial was televised and the victims identity became known resulting in her being vilified by almost the entire town the rapists were convicted but the onlookers acquitted a huge march through the community was organised to celebrate the acquittals and the woman was in effect run out of town the feminist movement was at its height when isoyg was made in with a plethora of conferences and marches through cities protesting about rape domestic violence and unequal pay and arguably its weakest at the time of the accused when thatcherism had more or less destroyed the left and weakened feminism alongside it in a way isoyg was a revengeraperevenge story perhaps serving as an unconscious warning to women about getting too uppity the accused was a fairytale about how we would like things to be but had failed to make happen during the glory days of the womens movement whereas the accused serves as a warning to men who do nothing to stop rape the punishment they receive in the film is highly unlikely to happen in reality the revenge meted out in isoyg however is something men should fear it does not rely on the law of the land but on a woman being pushed too far and deciding enough is enough i sat through a murder trial in the s in which a woman stabbed and killed the man who had raped her child the jury against the directions of the judge acquitted her i still believe in our criminal justice system and am against vigilante attacks but the fact remains that the majority of men who rape women get away with it if i were gangraped aware as i am of the near impossibility of winning justice through the courts i would not be sitting here fantasising about being saved by crusading lawyers and nice men i stand by the pickets against the videonasty genre years ago but on reflection i was wrong about isoyg being harmful it was and still is exploitative but at least it does not present the criminal justice system as a friend to women if rape remains as easy to get away with as it is at present films in which women get even through the legal system will become as unrealistic as isoyg but i know which one will give me and many other women the most comfort i spit on your grave is in cinemas from january,2011-01,wa time early seemed picket every week one best wa leeds cinema video nasties

back in the heady days of s feminism there was an argument that once women achieved political power there would be no more war margaret thatcher and her falklands war exploded that myth and along with it any residual notion that women might do foreign policy differently from men indeed it became a credibility requirement for any women with a senior foreign or defence brief to give a wide berth to anything with a whiff of being a womans issue women had to work extra hard to look tough on the world stage meanwhile womens issues were parked in the softer brief of international development it is these unspoken rules that hillary clinton has been dismantling since becoming us secretary of state two years ago she is the most powerful politician to advance an explicitly feminist agenda even in that most delicate and crucial relationship with china on which the worlds attention will be fixed this week for the chinese presidents visit to the us clinton has gone out of her way to press feminist issues in chinas case she has highlighted the countrys growing gender imbalance caused by the high abortion rate of female foetuses inevitably some see it as a recasting of us imperialism others as a force for the progressive good ill come on to what it stacks up to but the first point is to marvel at how she has got away with it on countless occasions since arriving at the state department clinton has asserted that the rights of women and girls are now core to us foreign policy its hard to imagine any british foreign secretary ever saying such a thing many of her statements can be routed back to the idealistic internationalism of s feminism astonishingly she has managed to bring the feminism for which she was loathed in the early s as the first lady who didnt stay home and bake cookies into the heart of the state department and foreign policy and is still clocking high opinion poll ratings from the start clinton left no one in any doubt where she stood womens rights are the signature issue of this administrations foreign policy she said she mentioned women times in speeches in the first five months in office transformation of the role of women is the last great impediment to universal progress she declared and began to develop what is her standard line womens issues are integral to the achievement of every goal of us foreign policy or put more simply the empowerment participation and protection of women and girls is vital to the longterm security of the us last month this rhetoric was translated into policy in the long awaited quadrennial diplomacy and development review which aimed to redefine us foreign policy around civilian power we are integrating women and girls into everything we do in all our diplomacy with other governments in our work on conflict and crisis said the state departments briefing for a security agenda traditionally dominated by weaponry and military expertise this is radical stuff it draws on a powerful consensus built up behind the overwhelming evidence that women are vital to a range of key global concerns links have been drawn between gross gender inequality and political extremism women are crucial on issues such as food security women produce most of the food that feeds the world health education and democracy the world bank picked up this agenda long ago and a raft of unexpected allies have emerged such as the economist lawrence summers who said that the most effective investment in development is the education of girls clinton has been riding a wave of optimism that women hold the key to global development and peace she makes this abstract thinking concrete on her foreign visits her press entourage finds itself dragged around meetings with microcredit groups activists and politicians all women its strategic she admitted in an interview its a constant effort to elevate people who in their societies may not even be known by their own leaders my coming gives them a platform which then gives us the chance to try and change the priorities of governments when she visited south africa she spent twice as much time with a womens housing project as she did with the president she has carefully chosen key issues and pushed hard perhaps her greatest success so far has been to highlight sexual violence as a weapon of war anne marie goetz of un women argues that sexual violence is an even more destructive weapon than landmines or cluster bombs on communities because its effects are so long term but repeatedly the issue was marginalised or ignored in conflict resolution or peacekeeping in clinton visited the democratic republic of the congo and talked to rape victims and she has been instrumental in the passage of a series of un security council resolutions that have put real teeth into tackling the issue the appointment of a special representative last april margaret wallstrm the naming of perpetrators and a dedicated team of experts to pursue them clinton was also key to setting up un women which started work last week in particular she is credited with persuading the former chilean president michele bachelet to take the top job take another issue for which womens groups had struggled to get recognition one of the biggest killers of women and children in the developing world is cooking stoves inhalation of smoke from open fires kills million a year plus gathering firewood makes women and girls vulnerable to sexual violence quite apart from the environmental consequences of chopping down trees yet the issue has had a fraction of the attention of aidshiv or malaria last september clinton launched a global alliance for clean cookstoves with a us pledge of m and a target of m stoves by one observer said it was classic clinton very practical its modest but makes a massive difference but it took a woman to get it observers on both sides of the atlantic acknowledge shes a gamechanger they say the prominence she gives key issues enables them to be taken seriously but for all the enthusiasm its clear there are major constraints on this agenda it gets nowhere in the middle east while afghanistan presents a big challenge clinton has insisted peace cannot come at the cost of womens rights but the signs arent good that she can hold this line meanwhile there are critics who worry that her advocacy could backfire and antagonise conservative societies and even prove inimical to us interests it could generate resentment and suspicion says stephen walt a professor of international relations at harvard he points out the us cant even sort out its own problems of sexual inequality so it is overly optimistic to think it can have much impact in yemen congo or india clinton is careful to couch her feminism in talk of us interests and splice it into a hawkish toughness to reassure her domestic audience she has picked her issues carefully and made some big compromises to keep people on side her feminism has obviously been helpful for the obama administration which is anxious to redesign us foreign policy in the midst of two disastrous foreign wars it could still reap dividends for women but the question is will it be quietly sidelined

last week five people in japan launched a lawsuit against the japanese government claiming that a civil law forcing them to choose a single surname after marriage violates their constitutional rights in japan you currently cannot legally marry and have a separate surname from your spouse only one surname is allowed per married couple what this means is that women overwhelmingly adopt their husbands surname i got married back in and changed my last name to my husbands at i was young and an exception to the trend of women marrying late and i didnt even think about not changing my family name i always thought that when you get married you change your family name to your husbands that was the normal thing to do there was no room for feminism in my youth in rural japan although many grown women i knew were doing some kinds of parttime job it was always the husband who was the breadwinner taking care of the family in my case it was a little different i married a canadian changing my name required lots of paperwork due to the family registry system koseki in japan when i was single i was under my fathers registry as one of his dependents once you get married a new family unit is formed under a new head of the registry usually the husband but in my case since my spouse was nonjapanese he could not become the new head of the registry and i had to be so i could have easily kept my maiden name for our family but didnt why even though i dont consider myself conservative i was young and thought thats what you were supposed to do after hearing about the ongoing lawsuit i asked my japanese friends on twitter about their thoughts many said it was probably a good idea to have a choice whether to change your surname or to keep your maiden name and yes this sounds pretty fair to me however there are still a lot of oppositions to this idea one of the biggest reasons concerns the child what is the childs surname going to be if the parents had two different surnames this is easily solved in north america with hyphenation although such an idea seems radical for the japanese others argue the idea of the family unit is something very unique in japan and we should honour it and those who believe in it worry if wife and husband start using different surnames the meaning of family will be lost with my anecdotal research on twitter i have also found a few women who chose not to get married in order for her to keep using her surname however their reason is not always about gender equality changing your surname after marriage is inconvenient if you are working especially so if you are well established under your own surname some women choose to keep using their maiden name in the workplace one woman i talked to said that in japan this was a social and economical issue because as soon as the government gets involved with passports social insurance payroll and related matters the name you use has to be in the family registry japan is a very bureaucratic country changing a family name involves a lot of tedious paperwork with my anecdotal research i could not find many women insisting on holding onto her family name for political reasons they just want everything to be simple and if you can keep your family name after you get married it makes things a whole lot easier,2011-01,last week five people japan launched lawsuit japanese government claiming civil law forcing choose single surname marriage violates constitutional right japan currently legally marry separate surname spouse one surname allowed per married couple mean

theres a big subject here that weve been chatting about for a while but ive avoided writing about it in part because i know its a minefield and whatever i write im bound to put someones back up and cause offence but also because its a subject about which i have many more doubts than certainties and dont honestly know what i think im probably only writing about it now in the hope that someone out there can enlighten me the whole debate began because a guest was doing a job i cant even remember what it was now and at the end he proudly stepped back to admire what he had done he idly said that makes me feel like a man but immediately began to worry that a sentence like that was sexist as if by suggesting that a labour was specifically enhancing to male selfesteem implied it was something a woman couldnt do i thought it all rather funny just at the moment he was feeling like a man he had an inner voice of stcentury egalitarianism telling him that maybe he shouldnt feel like a man so we started laughing and got talking about it and then started chatting about the whole thing with a few women here and weve kind of been thinking about it ever since ive always thought or hoped that one of the reasons a place like this might work for men at least is that there are plenty of manly things to do if youre felling trees or chopping wood or feeding pigs or building shelters its hard not to sense that youre straining your sinews and somehow proving yourself at primitive tasks thats quite a consolation to those who feel that the contemporary badges of manliness inasmuch as they exist at all any more have passed them by or more probably are not worth much anyway in a society in which men are largely deprived of anything that makes them feel manly a large wallet fast car or fancy phone has never done it for me or i suspect millions of others its perhaps not surprising that so many of us long just to swing an axe and yet theres nothing about any of those tasks ive mentioned that are at all gender specific in fact the only professional forester who has been here recently was a woman the best pig breeder round here is a woman so im not sure what i think any more i find myself in the strange position of hoping that any male guest who comes here might if he needs to regain selfesteem through feeling like a man whatever that may mean but at the same time realising there might be something excluding in their saying so is there an equivalent phrase for women someone suggested having a girlie day but im not sure what that would mean either surely not as one friend says just a session buying shoes and then watching multiple episodes of gossip girl and if were not supposed to say something makes us feel like men what are we supposed to say it makes me feel like a human being what interests me is whether leading a slightly more primitive existence inevitably leads to more primitive gender roles and whether that would be a bad thing i can already hear the sucking of teeth so let me assure you that blokes here do their fair share of washing up cooking and so on in fact a friend whos on a similar journey up north has become a dab hand with a sewing machine as he stitches canvasses for yurts so its not a question of becoming chauvinistic cavemen but there is something that happens when you go back to the land when you become diggers again we had noticed it on other communities and are beginning to notice it here oldfashioned gender roles are subtly reasserted when for example youve got to smash in stakes through ice and very rocky ground with a kg post rammer you probably want a man on the job am i allowed to say that i suppose it all comes down to the old chestnut of whether its better to accept and treasure gender differences or to ignore and move beyond them what has surprised me is that so many people men and women seem contented rather than frustrated to rediscover the differences to read more about tobiass project go to

children say the cutest things over christmas one of mine told me that years ago she asked me why i was a feminist it was on the way to school and i am not a morning person possibly she was expecting something about equal pay apparently i snapped because men do horrible horrible things she was alarmed that was bad of me wasnt it a little sexist warping the mind of a young girl she is now grown up and thinks its funny its probably not in any childcare manual and the right answer would have been stuff about wanting equal opportunities or i could have replied that anyone with a brain man or woman would see the necessity of feminism i could have been inclusive nowadays saying bad stuff about men is not how feminism conducts itself we all lurve men we are all smiley for fear of being labelled manhaters and what is the result of this peoplepleasing ultrafeminine crowdsourced sexual politics sod all reasonably sitting around waiting for equality while empowering oneself with some silicone implants does not really seem to have worked wonders does it ladeez postfeminism as personified by the sex and the city generation basically confused sexual liberation with shopping a mistaken strategy even within its own marketdriven terms so we live on a permanent diet of crumbs from the table a woman over gets to be on tv whoopdiwhoop its a victory sure but is that all there is its time to wake up and smell the skinny latte a woman is murdered in bristol and the response is to tell women to stay at home for their own safety though no one thinks its a woman doing the murdering a curfew on men would be considered a monstrous idea even though most women live with internalised curfews anyway an argument about gangs of men who groom young women for sex becomes an argument about ethnicity and faith of course these are issues to be discussed but the central issue surely is the abuse of children turning vulnerable young girls into drugaddicted prostitutes is disgusting in any culture but it wouldnt be a viable proposition if men did not want sex with these children as with all arguments about prostitution the one group we rarely hear from are the men who buy sex the punters i dont like the jargon sex workers we are all sex workers these days unless we are celibate as we are all encouraged to pursue lifelong sexiness most young women are endlessly groomed to be desirable after all yet the men who have sex with young frightened addled girls choose to do so such sex we are told is about power to have sex in a car with a heroin addict is very cheap indeed it goes on day in and day out and of course it makes me wonder about male sexuality as does the use of rape as a weapon of war to say these things is not to say all men are rapists but some are to not say them does not make it stop it is as though feminism had to sex itself up to keep itself interesting we are not hairy manhaters who bang on about domestic violence and abuse we are fascinating women interested in fashion relationships and true intimacy ok so we have a few little problems like having it all turning into doing it all and finding a nice guy to do any of it with at all but look on the bright side we have got a few more female mps our girls are doing well at school and isnt life grand well no no it isnt just as the third way or triangulation produced a dire shutting down of political discourse the triangulation of feminism the third wave as it was often called has produced pitiful results part of the problem was that what many american feminists were writing in the last decade was simply superimposed onto british culture it didnt work we dont have a moral majority to see naomi wolf that histrionic proponent of the third wave pop up to demand that the women accusing julian assange of sexual assault and rape be named surely they have already been shamed is a logical conclusion of this deal it is a dead end much of wolfs work is privileged narcissism dressed up as struggle the beauty myth did not have an original thought in it but never mind it remains the only feminist text read by many wolf and many of her contemporaries muddled the personal with the political to such a degree it is embarrassing wolf was snapped up by the media as she was beautiful as though feminists couldnt be greer and steinem were lookers werent they wolfs argument now about the anonymity of accusers in rape trials arrives on these shores a little after the lib dems dropped this peculiar proposal which was never in their manifesto anyway weirdly this was really the only thing the lib dems have had to say about women since being in power there are valid arguments to be made about not treating rape differently to other crimes but the police here know many women wont come forward and all are aware of our appallingly low conviction rates still everyone seems to lose their heads around assange i picture bianca jagger washing his feet with her tears soon wolf actually compared him to oscar wilde the similarity is that they were both in solitary confinement practically the same person then of course wolf has every right to think what she likes about assanges accusers and to change her mind as she did about abortion but what kind of feminism is she now espousing i find it very difficult to know god how i miss those troublesome women like andrea dworkin and shulamith firestone they may have been as batty as hell but they had passion and balls they were properly furious at the horrible things men do to women who in their right mind male or female isnt your mother your sister your daughter are being told to stay inside and not complain too much take up knitting or vajazzling maybe or take comfort from gideons we are all in this together the last election was the most regressive for women i can remember women appeared as trophy wives or not at all the consequences of that are that this government this new way of doing politics is hitting women and children the hardest women are suffering most from the cuts that men are making just look at the figures this makes me very angry indeed which i know may increase visible signs of ageing but its way too late now feminism has been dumbed down into politeness and partypolitical promises for far too long the backlash is happening in front of our eyes recession of course leads to reactionary measures and some of this reaction is taking away the few gains women have made we can take nothing for granted we need fire in our belly for this fight not a bleedin gastric bypass angry

academic experts on violence against women have criticised safety advice issued by police after the murder of joanna yeates as unhelpful and impractical avon and somerset police have advised women not to walk alone in bristol after dark despite saying they have no specific intelligence to suggest there was any increased risk in the city members of the university of bristols centre for gender and violence research said such advice meant at this time of year women could go out alone between about am and pm which would make life impossible lois bibbings a senior law lecturer and tanya palmer who is researching sexual violence dismissed the stance as well meaning but impractical in an article on the case published in the bristol evening post they wrote this is simply impossible for most ordinary women who have jobs social lives and children to take to and from school this type of guidance is still routinely offered by the police in circumstances such as the present mystery surrounding ms yeatess homicide unfortunately such advice while wellmeaning can be unhelpful without information about any specific threat to womens safety telling women not to go out alone after dark distracts from what is known about the contexts in which women and men are likely to experience violence women are most at risk of violence committed by someone they know often in the home bibbings and palmer said it about two women a week die as a result of domestic violence the reality is distorted when attention is focused on the danger of violence from strangers men are in fact more likely than women to be victims of violence in public places they added warnings to stay indoors are impractical for everyone and there is a danger that such warnings distract us from the huge problem of violence against both women and men the centre said advice given by the university to staff and the thousands of students returning to the city after the christmas break was more helpful the advice given by bristol university encourages all students and staff to take precautions such as sticking to welllit and busy areas and being aware of their surroundings in doing so it acknowledges that people do need to walk around the city after dark and sometimes alone avon and somerset police also advised householders to keep premises secure and take care when answering the door to strangers meanwhile police sources have said the investigation into the murder of yeates who went missing on december is progressing steadily the officer leading the investigation has not given a press conference for a week but sources say this is not because the inquiry lacks direction but because the team is working through more than leads figures presented to avon and somerset police authority

how antiwomen is the guardian this might seem an odd question for those brought up on the idea that the guardian has always been associated with a feminist perspective embodied in the work of mary stott columnist jill tweedie and in the present day polly toynbee however some correspondents feel that the guardian in print and online doesnt do enough to defend and promote women i am writing to complain about the sexism on comment is free and the failure of the guardian to acknowledge or address the lack of female commenters below the line and the predominance of antifeminist and sexist male bloggers wrote one correspondent who had prepared a spreadsheet with an analysis of the gender of the commenters the article on rape the left still doesnt get it of december highlights this in the first comments ie the front page there are identifiably male and five female posters i have included only those who have stated their gender in profiles or posts however unless one looks to the profile archive the anonymous nature of posting hides this disparity it is not obvious that there is no substantive contribution to this discussion by women many of the posters are habitually sexist commentators the hostile culture women face on comment is free must encourage their absence naomi wolfs article on january which argued that the women accusing men of rape should not have anonymity brought forth this comment it is their fault the guardian they know this is manna from heaven to the cif comment is free mob they are chief cheerleaders for the daily mail campaign against rape victims they are providing a platform for the kind of propaganda that persuaded dave that rape anonymity for defendants would be such a great first move for his government and meanwhile the rape conviction rate stays exactly where it always was her solution would be to turn off the comments on issues that traditionally attract antiwomen comments such as those that relate to mens rights and be even tougher on moderating the comments a regular reader of our letters page has also been counting out of letters published on december only two were from women of the five shorts only one from a woman sadly my ongoing analysis of the letters page of the guardian and other thoughtful nationals is that this is a relatively good day for women she goes so far as to suggest that before letters are selected they should be made gender neutral so that the editor would not know whether they came from a man or woman universities have gone to the expense of making exam papers gender neutral before they are marked which has curiously at a single stroke improved the performance of women students the deputy letters editor said that he recognises there is a disparity but that there are many fewer letters written by women he feels and there are women who edit the letters page too that this may be a reflection of a broader gender bias in society as a whole against a traditionally male background the editor of cif is a woman as are the editor of the newspaper comment pages and the overall head of comment in print and online of guardian editorial staff are women cifs editor has already written that cif is crucially about both the articles and the comments and has made it a priority in her first six months in the job to improve the nature of the debates on the site she said it was impossible to conclusively prove the sex of commenters which made analysis difficult but she is committed to encouraging diversity on the site i want a wider range of voices especially more women joining the

tanya gold is right to criticise the view that women gravitate towards lowpaid occupations by choice rather than because of discrimination inequality lets not have legislation ladies lets lunch

catherine hakim a sociologist at the london school of economics has written a report called feminist myths and magic medicine the flawed thinking behind calls for further equality legislation published by the thatcherite thinktank the centre for policy studies it concludes that mainstream feminist thinking on gender equality is flawed and governments should forget trying to promote it its conclusions are zinging through the rightwing press so i picked it up reading it is an astonishing experience like eating joseph stalin then zsa zsa gabor and then going on holiday to and throwing up all over yourself hakim begins by stating that the war for gender equality is over she believes that equal opportunity policies have been successful so should now be closed down and possibly sold into slavery because it is a business that no longer makes money it has been successful in the past but wont be in the future a contradiction i dont fully understand unless she is also a soothsayer except of course it isnt true equality legislation has failed unless you are content to see women have less than men we still earn less own less have worse jobs and will suffer more in the recession than men we are woefully underrepresented in government industry and the professions and overrepresented in cleaning catering and ballet so how does hakim who writes like a talking boil on the neck of norman tebbit make her thesis fly well she has a list of myths which she thinks are peddled by the foolish feminist establishment whom she treats as a lump with one mouth and one opinion for seeking to portray women as universal victims and yet we have politicians in thrall to our myths like the witches of macbeth transported to strasbourg and there we demand absolute equality and completely symmetrical roles for men and women so we can live in a monochrome hell she begins by saying the pay gap in britain could be as low as whats in a big fat capitalist economy its actually according to the fawcett society and shouldnt exist at all then she says that equality policies legislation for shared parental leave female quotas gender pay audits etc dont work well some do and some dont surely this means they need refinement not annihilation if the criminal code is imperfect we dont abolish the justice system or maybe we should and so to occupational segregation and the phenomenon of women gravitating to lowerpaid work by choice which hakim really seems to believe few women aspire to be engineers or soldiers and few men choose to be nursery teachers and beauticians she says we cannot assume that a low percentage of women in highergrade jobs is due primarily to sex discrimination perhaps we are just more bovine than men or maybe until business truly supports familyfriendly policies we feel we need to look after our children occasionally although hakim normally has data flowing out of her fingertips there is none in this passage which makes me wonder if her assumption is based on a weird mad menthemed dream she had on boxing day she seems ignorant of the fact that the battle for equality is a process and that culture influences aspirations and culture as all sociologists should know can change what about scandinavian policies such as shared parental leave and better state childcare the models for equality legislation they dont deliver gender equality she says illustrating this with statistics published as long as years ago which are disputed by more recent studies again some do some dont the pay gap in scandinavia is the lowest in the world though occupational segregation is still a problem is dr hakim going to throw the baby which should obviously be cared for only by its mother out with the bath water and so she goes on often proving the feminists point for them as she wanders through her smallstate dreamscape developed countries dont have better records than underdeveloped she says again i suggest more action not less and these statistics are disputed too more women in work doesnt always mean progress either she says that is because they fly straight into the lowerpaid professions and obviously ballet dr hakim and what does this prove except that we need more legislation not less if women are university educated she goes on it doesnt change their prospects compared to men who are university educated again what does this prove except that there is a problem but hakim doesnt notice the contradictions because she is off on another rant about how men are happier in management than women its all about work orientations and career choices dont ya know again she confuses choice with cultural coercion she doesnt pause to consider that women need more legislation to smash a status quo that places all responsibility for childcare on women most women seek some combination of paid work and family work she says hardly a revelation to melt the gravestone of emmeline pankhurst if men are not encouraged to look after their children and suffer at work if they do women will obviously do it they dont love the markets as much as hakim and there is plenty of evidence that men prefer sharing childcare and enjoy flexible working hours men are more likely to be careerist she muses but she doesnt turn her spyglass to business practice and ask why only two myths to go then i can go punch a wall familyfriendly policies hakim says dont make companies more profitable although she adds some analyses show a small link between these policies and profitability is small not good enough just as a pay gap is good enough as for profitability there is plenty of evidence to suggest otherwise can refusing to use the full intelligence of half the population really be a moneymaking wheeze the most spiteful passage is where hakim notes womens aspiration to marry up if they can to a man who is better educated and higherearning women thereby continue to use marriage as an alternative or supplement to their employment careers the implication is repellent but the truth is we earn less they earn more so if we marry it is likely our husbands will earn more than us this is not a lifestyle choice it is an injustice and so to my favourite bit in which hakim lays into female quotas on company boards which she calls a waste of public funds and irresponsible there are better ways of inspiring women to achieve than actually helping them achieve the financial timess women at the top event is especially effective by publishing a list of the worlds top female business leaders she suggests perhaps lowpaid women can copy them out in their lunch hour she also likes the woman of the year lunch lets not have legislation lets have lunch and there you have it the current thinking on gender equality hakim says she wants equality of opportunity but nowhere does she support the measures that might achieve it its going to be a long cold winter sisters suzanne moore is away,2011-01,catherine hakim sociologist

aung san suu kyi oprah winfrey tanni greythompson jk rowling even dare i say it margaret thatcher to celebrate the th anniversary of international womens day this year the guardian is planning to compile a list of top women in the world and would like you to help given the abundance of choice about half of a roughly billionstrong global population how do we choose as a general rule we think the women who make the list should be there for their ability to inspire they should be successful in their own right but also have achieved something for other women whether through their work or by acting as role models most lists emphasise power and influence and of course economic and political clout matter or the way a woman looks or dresses but the ability of women to inspire either by improving the lot of others or acting as a role model is also important for the next generation of women over the coming years on the first international womens day years ago people marched across europe campaigning for womens rights to vote work be trained and hold public office much has changed since then these basic rights are taken for granted in large parts of the world women have risen to pole political positions in many countries including the uk yet discrimination persists women make up between and of the worlds poor illiterate and refugee populations and sexual and domestic violence continues to cause alarm a girl growing up in chad today has about the same chance of dying while giving birth as she has of going to secondary school pregnancy is the biggest killer of women aged to in the developing world while girls often do better than boys at school women working fulltime in the uk are paid on average less per hour than men years after the equal pay act and fill just of boardroom posts in leading companies yet the ability of women to rise above such discrimination has also persisted whether in the fields of arts science education health commerce or politics indeed there are a number of women in positions of political authority this year from angela merkel in germany to dilma rousseff in brazil and michelle bachelet the first female chilean president who became the united nations first executive director of women the uks only female prime minister margaret thatcher was named in a recent poll conducted by yougov and aol uk as this countrys most influential woman would it be possible to exclude her even though few argue that her politics did much to help women and how about beyonc or cheryl cole then there are stories that inspire some such as shirin ebadi the human rights activist and first muslim woman to win the nobel prize have already won recognition others are less well known the indian lawyer who took on the case of a destitute woman who died giving birth in a delhi street and won a landmark ruling from the high court last year for women in a similar position there are so many others from writers to teachers to community workers as well as those who have risen to national prominence by being the first to do something this isnt an attempt to provide a definitive list but a chance for you to tell us about women who inspire you women too often fail to make standard power lists and this is an attempt to redress that while celebrating a good cause the list will be published on march the nominees must be alive but can live anywhere it wont be difficult finding inspirational women the tricky bit will be narrowing them down nominate an inspirational woman here,2011-01,aung san suu kyi oprah winfrey tanni greythompson jk

january in las vegas the sun the shows the casinos and yes the adult entertainment expo the worlds biggest porn convention every january pornographers from all over the world descend on las vegas to participate in seminars learn about industry trends network with peers meet the new creative talent and keep up with the latest technology when i attended the expo from sitting in the business seminars it quickly became clear that what excites these guys and it was overwhelmingly men is not sex but money they spend hours in airless poorly lit conference rooms discussing niche markets product diversification and how to generate website traffic because as the expo website says identifying selling and marketing the right products for your existing customers and attracting new ones is vital in todays competitive marketplace as these predatory capitalists figure out ways to expand their customer base a few yards away in a cavernous convention hall the very people they are analysing are mingling with their favourite porn performers watching snippets of the latest movies and eagerly awaiting what the organisers call sexy stage shows where female porn performers simulate sex with each other when i walked around the hall looking at the porn movies on display i watched women being choked with penises till they gagged being roughly penetrated by men who called them slut bitch and cum dumpster and in one particularly bizarre case being anally penetrated while in a coffin wandering around the room i saw porn performers dressed in the usual garb of thongs highheeled shoes and not much else sitting on tables with their legs spread as men lined up to pose with them so their friends could take pictures my interviews with the fans waiting in line revealed that they had bought the official party line porn was about fun and fantasy not reality and we shouldnt take it too seriously i wanted to drag these fans over to the conference rooms to show them just how wrong they were to show them the venture capitalists producers directors and distributors who took porn very seriously indeed and so they should a multibilliondollar industry that produces more than films a year in the united states alone the porn business is embedded in a complex value chain linking not just film producers and distributors but also bankers software producers credit card companies internet providers cable companies and hotel chains porn has been a major source of revenue for hotels for some time now with chains such as holiday inn hilton sheraton radisson hyatt and marriott making a lot of money from payperview tv in an article on the porn industry business site xbiz put the annual revenues from hotel porn at over m the article continued by pointing out that hotel porn not only makes money for the hotels but also for the companies that supply it which include megagiants such as lodgenet and on command it is no accident that the international consumer electronics show takes place in las vegas at the exact same time as the expo porn has helped drive the technologies that expand its own market according to jonathan coopersmith a historian of technology porn has proven to be a reliable highly profitable market segment that has accelerated the development of media technologies from vcrs and dvds to filesharing networks video on demand for cable streamed video over the internet for pcs and most recently video for mobile phones video uses vast quantities of data and the demand for porn has driven the development of core crossplatform technologies for data compression search transmission and micropayments filesharing networks such as kazaa gnutella and limewire are better known for music but are widely used for porn video files too some of the themes that ran through many of the seminars at the expo were how to integrate porn into pop culture create a favourable public image for the business and sidestep regulation the pornography industry unlike most other industries cant directly advertise its products on television or in newspapers so it has to rely on pr companies such as bsg public relations to place pornfriendly stories in the mainstream media there are hundreds of examples to draw from here jenna jameson on the oprah winfrey show talking about how empowered she feels from making porn hugh hefner being interviewed by yet another newspaper an article in cosmopolitan on how watching porn is a fun way for women to spice up their sex lives or the popular tshirts with porn star written across the chest the cumulative effect is what the journalist pamela paul calls the pornification of our culture wherein porn images messages and stories seep into our sexual identities and relationships this trend can be seen in the everhigher heels that are now popular with women the hypersexed look of younger and younger girls celebrities such as miley cyrus pole dancing and in what is probably the most blatant example to date the popularity of genital waxing among young women this practice became widespread in porn about a decade ago and now is so commonplace that it is almost impossible to find female performers with pubic hair meanwhile shaving has become so accepted among my female students that they tell me they are repulsed by their pubic hair and so are their sex partners some of whom refuse to have sex with them if they are not fully waxed this makes perfect sense given that many of these men got most of their sex education from porn this phobia has ironically given women one unexpected if meagre weapon in their struggle to maintain a semblance of sexual autonomy the trick i learned about it at a college lecture i gave a few years ago a student in the audience started talking about the trick as if everyone knew what it is and in fact most of the other women nodded their understanding and familiarity with the practice well it turns out that women who want to avoid sex on a particular night out purposely dont shave or wax beforehand so that they will feel too embarrassed to participate in casual sex when i asked them why they couldnt just say no to sex they informed me that saying no was too difficult given the pressure to have sex so they pulled the trick on the guy of course the trick really demonstrates just how little sexual autonomy and control the porn culture affords young women one of the seminars at this years expo is called in the company of women here academics will mix with pornographers to share ideas on how to develop niche products targeted to women im sure there will be lots of talk about how women can be empowered by watching porn because the pornographers being the savvy businessmen they are like nothing more than telling women that porn is actually good for them this is their trick and one we must resist if we want to replace the plasticised formulaic and generic images of the pornographers with an authentic sexuality based on our own experiences longings and

the core belief of prunella stacks mother was that movement is life which became the slogan of the organisation she founded and passed on to her daughter despite many personal losses prunella lived that belief and shared it with hundreds of thousands of members of the womens league of health and beauty the most innocuous of the interwar mass fitness movements to her end prunella who has died aged remained physically and mentally flexible ready for whatever came next perhaps the worst loss had happened before prunella took her first step she was born in india daughter of a gurkha rifles officer captain edward hugh bagot stack and his irish beauty of a wife mary in september he and his men embarked for france mary and her baby sailed for britain edward was killed at the front before his wife and daughter landed other war widows turned to spiritualism despair or cocktails but as a bride in india mary had observed with interest the physical differences between the immobile imperialists corseted petticoated shod in button boots at least a size too tight and indian women of all castes able to bend from an unconstrained waist their feet free in sandals movement is life she concluded movement could also be female emancipation newly important in postwar britain mental as much as bodily health and perhaps a crossclass and cultural force for peace mary had vim enough to set up her first classes then the bagot stack health school in london where she taught teachers among them prunella who qualified in aged yet already a veteran demonstrator of marys techniques marys health worsened through prunellas childhood but wanting to reach many more women she started the womens league of health and beauty in when leagues were all the rage membership fee two shillings and sixpence uniform an affordable sleeveless blouse and satin knickers abbreviating over time from bloomers to shorts the choreography of the era adopted alike by communists fascists and busby berkeley in hollywood was for synchronised mass formations and the league created its own sprightly not too sexy version first shown publicly in the albert hall in by the time members lifted their arms in unison in olympia in young prunella was head of the league mary had died and prunella had inherited her task expanding british membership and extending it to the empire she addressed the prime minister neville chamberlains national fitness council the government had discovered keeping fit as a cheap route to express modernity defy the depression and discreetly prepare for war prunella was the leagues best advertisement the picture papers perfect girl of unaffected manners unpainted fingernails and longer more lensworthy legs than any film star in a scots mp invited her to open a school swimming pool with an inaugural dive she obliged and met the mps brother lord david douglas hamilton youngest son of the th duke of hamilton he soon proposed the settingup of a highlands fitness school and marriage she agreed to both and off they went mountaineering together in the alps posthoneymoon prunella led a league delegation to an international congress of physical fitness in hamburg in she was unnerved by the nazi strength through joy devotees but courteously hosted a german return visit the next year soon the alert women of the league were volunteering for war service prunella retreated to dorset for the duration to take care of her two baby sons david achieved wartime glamour as an raf squadron leader surviving the rafs most brutal years and air battles only to crash short of the runway because of engine failure on return from a mission just after dday in mary had been when she was widowed and so was prunella but there was work for her to do in britain and in the commonwealth that was displacing the empire women had had adventures beyond a little light exercise in the war years and as a friend of kurt hahn who founded gordonstoun school and outward bound prunella began to imagine an equivalent organisation to offer excitement to girls hardly soe but better than back to the apron another friend was alistair albers who taught her boys zulu dances and invited them all to visit his native south africa she accepted and they married there in she decided that the league would ignore the new racial laws the league welcomed women of all shapes and sizes also all creeds and colours and opened unsegregated exercise classes alistair and prunella climbed for fun tackling table mountain several times but on an ascent on easter day in he lost his hold and fell to his death the league and her strong religious faith sustained her through her second widowhood defying the authorities she led a multiracial team to the coronation in london the organisation continued with prunella as president and still continues now called the fitness league although overshadowed as decades passed by the commercialisation and sexualisation of female exercise few gyms teach women how to walk with bowls balanced on their heads marys idea to maintain spinal flexibility based on her indian memories or stress female cooperation rather than competition girls were eventually admitted to outward bound and so was prunella as vicepresident of its trust from the year she was also appointed obe after her return to london she had a happy third marriage to brian power a barrister whose fascinating past of war and farflung places matched her own in lieu of retiring they bought an austere croft on the isle of raasay in the hebrides and there encouraged each other to write she an autobiography and manuals of movement he a fine memoir of a vanished china and to stay lithe pedalling their bicycles right up to his death in she is survived by her sons diarmaid an

women on boards wob is the name of the inquiry led by lord davies of abersoch into male dominance in uk boardrooms dominance is about right currently only of ftse directors are women of the ftse have no female directors at all and progress is so slow that lord davies estimates that at this rate it would take more than years to sort out wob wants of board vacancies to be filled by women by management consultancy mckinsey says this would require only one in three appointments to be women however there will be no mandatory quotas a la norway where boards must be female by law wob discovered overwhelming opposition to enforced quotas concern that the appointments would look tokenistic leading to a devaluation of female achievements basically a big gooey lipsticked kiss of career death lord daviess conclusion was that companies should voluntarily set themselves targets and frankly do their best to meet them hmm and if their best is frankly not good enough well there would be reviews investigations it might take a while though you know how it is more meetings with posh biscuits years passing tumbleweed blowing so do women still think that tokenism is the very worst thing that could happen to them who in their right mind believes that the glass ceiling could be smashed within a few years with a teensy weensy tap from a voluntary toffee hammer more to the point when did tokenism outstrip sexism as the big female corporate bogeyman so what if there is tokenism especially with the odds so stacked against women the inquiry cites opaque recruitment processes as one of the major problems men giving friends positions with barely an interview sometimes just because they are golf or squash buddies astonishing there is even something called the old boys network who knew except we all knew so whats with the selfflagellation over tokenism ladies indeed one of the most baffling wob findings was that many women opposed mandatory quotas wanting to be judged on their own merits etc but is this really so surprising or is it just indicative that even female high achievers of this calibre have been so skilfully groomed to apologise for their gender that they are now terrified of the t word has it got to the point that they balk at the thought of long overdue changes to unjust malecentric working practices work practices that dont even work that well a new book coaching women to lead points out that genderrich partnerships with women prosper up to better than those that are allmale research from mckinsey found that companies with more women on their boards outperformed rivals in myriad ways everyone is better off with more women fairly placed at the top and yet still theres this fretting over a genderbased fast track isnt it time that women stopped beating themselves up about tokenism and gave it its real name parity do the women who opposed mandatory quotas really want womankind spending the next years fretting about cliff from accounting not judging them on their merits in the twilight of their career will they be thrilled that they never gave some pinstripe snot the opportunity to devalue their achievements even if it did mean having to watch much lesser talents with different genitalia swan past them through the double doors to rich teas and glory its high time for women to make tokenism their friend own the dreaded t word have fun with the fact that thinking about it logically anyone could be lumped into a quota come a round of applause for the first female board member to turn to a male colleague and say just because youre only here to fill the male quota of it doesnt mean i think any less of you a boy in a dress isnt evil but size zero models are does andrej pejic modelling womens clothes truly symbolise the ultimate rejection of the female body by evil gay fashion designers the image i keep seeing is of pejic in a jean paul gaultier wedding gown the same crazee jpg whod send a unicorn down the runway if he could who designed madonnas ultrafemme coned bra whose perfume bottle is womanshaped is this a gay man who hates women whats so shocking about a boy in a dress anyway marilyn did the same in the s and no one had a radfem fit for the true face of catwalk evil look instead to the girl models some so emaciated they made samantha cameron blench in shock as for the accepted fact that fashion is full of gay men who hate women this isnt a fact its snide homophobic hogwash offensive to the hordes of committed gay professionals in the fashion industry if fashion has a problem and by zoolander it does its not covert hatred of the female rather its overt worship of youth and the bmi that comes with youth all this and worse could be said of fashion but lets keep the gaybashing out of it radiohead are running on empty theres a row about radioheads latest difficult new album the king of limbs some people believe it to be in the postmillennial radiohead tradition or as i like to put it more unlistenable whineyboy earpoo their marketing division can use that if they like others suggest that people have not spent enough time with limbs to comment fair point some albums are growers then again how much time do radiohead need theyve already been flailing around sounding like drunks tripping over jean michel jarres dustbins for a decade are we actually supposed to take sabbaticals to search through their turgid cacophonies for a melody singular just one guys dont be tight in my experience whenever reviewers are given no notice to um review its a sure sign that the band have produced a stinker or its a media powertrip keep the public uninformed yay smash the man the truth is one never needed time to realise that fake plastic trees high and dry or karma police were works of chilling beauty so why are we being urged to be patient with the king of limbs to hell with patience ill reserve my patience for helping old people across the road not for new albums by millionaire professionals they were a great band in their day but that doesnt give radiohead the right to keep releasing bizarre dirges that sound like cp being murdered to me limbs is the sound of radioheads fear fear that they cant hack writing melodies anymore so they pretend they never intended to and try to make people feel thick for not getting it maaan its rare and difficult to be able to keep writing beautiful tunes so admit it thom of yorke thats the real reason its not happening,2011-02,woman board wob name inquiry led lord davy abersoch male dominance uk boardroom dominance right

hello boys you are more than welcome here we expect you to be supportive but most men of intelligence already believe that women are at least equal to them and should be treated so or do they is it possible to be a male feminist does such as thing exist is it desirable as janice erlbaum put it feminist men oxymorons or simply morons i ask i guess because in the last few weeks when i have expressed anger i have inevitably been called a manhater the obvious response to this is men look at me cant get enough of them some of my best friends are and then acknowledge that men may even have emotions will this do just saying yeah some men are all right really is all too reminiscent of those sleazy guys who claim to love all women but dont in reality appear to like them much but yes the truth is i do see lots of guys doing their bit more and more they dont make a huge song and dance about it when my eldest was little in the early s a man at the school gates was rare with my youngest you cannot move for guys being great dads or if i want to be sour simply doing what women have always done but there they are not to acknowledge that men do more childcare or that some women are earning more than guys is disingenuous to not acknowledge the support that some men give women is to be unkind the most honest and prowoman doctor i have ever seen was a bloke should i say otherwise none of this though makes everything ok and none of it makes feminism any less of a necessity the raised male voices are increasingly those of men with strong antifeminist views the guys who just get on with it seem either unheard or unsure so someone like that peculiar mp dominic raab can call feminists obnoxious bigots and know there will be hear hears we are fed a diet of womens rights having gone too far equal opportunities madness and batshit crazy political correctness yet these gross generalisations do not resonate with generations of younger men brought up by working mothers and surrounded by girls who will have equalled them intellectually yes young men will have been raised with mixed messages about respecting women but some genuinely do many admire independent women and the choices they make and do not want a doormat at all but worry that should they speak up they will sound submissive the ghost of the new man stalks the land this ever so selfrighteous softer version of masculinity was partly created through sexual politics but really only existed so that advertisers could target a new market the new man was only ever a phantom very few men were new i vaguely recall some trying to behave a bit better in order to get off with more women but the new mans nemesis the lad soon took over to put everyone back in their place while faking subversion laddishness is simply what it says on the tin a version of masculinity that cannot mature it cannot actually live with itself it withers on the vine rehab or lives in admiration of lost lads oliver reed george best and keith moon postfeminism didnt require men to be anything more than the wielder of credit cards which is why it was scarcely politics at all but weaving between the stereotypes have been alliances between gay men and women and straight men and women trying simply to get by lots of people dont identify themselves with the f word but they are preoccupied with trying to understand the relations between the genders our mutual suspicion is in fact another market the selfhelp industry apart from claiming to cure cancer with creative visualisation also promises the equally implausible notion that men and women can live in harmony this requires a certain amount of training and these books are basically manuals in how to operate the opposite sex the market aint dumb mens health in america hardly some dworkinite hotbed of radicalism has just started a feminist blog why its author says i think a lot of people are probably feminist without even realising it was an opportunity to create and open up dialogues for both sexes dispel myths and negative connotations wow mens health which we thought was the bible of metrosexuality is talking about feminism the deputy editor of uks men health is more wary our readers have awareness we dont see the need to tag it as feminism once again the issue is not the issue but the word men can think feminist thoughts but lets not get carried away why is this so difficult it is easy enough to say one is antiracist why not the same with antisexism of course there is a history of men being involved in the womens movement some of it good some of it hilariously awful i remember guys turning up on prochoice marches and insisting they be at the front to make an impact i remember working at a leftwing magazine where the boss thought that getting in touch with his own feelings meant spurting them all over you and that any selfproclaimed feminist should be grateful for this there were guys who went off into woods mens movementstyle following the mythopoetics of robert bly and those who forced themselves to pee sitting down or be a bit gay or spend arduous hours ensuring their girlfriends had an orgasm as if this would give them points on some revolutionary clubcard there were the politics of selfactualisation which tipped into therapy mess and screaming i once went to a conference in birmingham where john stoltenberg author of refusing to be a man stood up and announced that he wasnt speaking as a man but as a penised individual yes really but now i think at least these guys spoke up maybe one small reason i want men to speak up again is that i have spent too long in the blogosphere reading the works of julian assanges supporters let me say again i do not know if this man is innocent or guilty of what he is charged with in sweden but i do know i have seen a massive amount of hatred of women or womanoids as some charmingly call us we are guilty of just about everything including creating an abuse industry funded by the nspcc ive read accounts from inside the mind of a sexual trade union feminist some men go so far as to quote pat robertson the american evangelist for whom feminism encourages women to leave their husbands kill their children practise witchcraft destroy capitalism and become lesbians anyone who believes in due process is a bunnyboiling whore or an operative for the cia so i have to remind myself that not all men think this way many would be appalled at the women in their lives being described in the ways i have seen where are the male voices to counter such misogyny are they scared of being patronised maybe but worse could happen women have always patronised men who said though we adore men individually we agree as a group theyre rather stupid yeah that crazed radical mary poppins so now right now when women are not well represented in politics when the poorest are being forced back into dependence on men when feminism is seen as having gone too far is it impossible to ask men to speak up in support is it uncool anyway what does a feminist man look like how about kurt cobain peter tatchell baaba maal antony hegarty bill bailey david steele and barak obama as my teams

the question what is marriage for the idea that the reason to get married is to express your love for each other or worse still to have a good kneesup with your friends is a modern nonsense love is an important part of marriage for sure but it is not a mandatory prerequisite after all reallife marriage is not a hollywood movie nor a cinderellaesque fairytale where the love story ends at the wedding weve got it backwards the love story begins at the wedding and ought to grow and its here that we seem to have got mixed up as a modern society the wedding is not the marriage the wedding is a gateway to marriage a formalised written commitment contractual agreements in personal relations are underrated these days you wouldnt buy a house or start a job without a contract but we have romantic notions that a verbal declaration of love is sufficient to entrust our life heart emotional and spiritual wellbeing in another person formal written structured agreements do have an impact on individuals harriet baber says security is the main reason for marriage but her argument is a negative one giving security against what she sees as the minus points of singledom but im arguing that commitment and contracts encourage a more positive state for the couple otherwise why put in the effort there is clarity of expectation and direction there is a clear understanding of joining together in union theres the positive mental attitude that says youre in it for the long haul and positive thinking is mighty powerful marriage in this sense is for the private good having structured units with parameters and responsibilities that society recognises is also for the public good offering stability respect and boundaries for that relationship and marriage seems to be a good thing for children too yet we have no training these days in how to initiate and manage relationships sex yes relationships no its all hollywood and heat magazine arguments about what marriage is for tend to focus on only one of the three components the couple society or children but the fact is that its a little bit of all three marriage is a formal written commitment between two people with clearly spelt out rights and responsibilities on both sides thats the problem with the expression of love or knees up approach to weddings instead of focusing on the relationship its all about the party these rights and responsibilities are recognised by wider society and enforced either legally or socially in our culture one example of these things is usually fidelity this is usually a clear expectation of both spouses and wider society is expected to support this hence we have the greater but sadly diminishing social stigma of having a relationship with someone who is married happy well supported and stable couples mean happier and more stable societies its mutually beneficial this is cif belief so i guess we ought to mention religion marriage has a central place in religion and islam is no exception so to cover off the religious aspect here is what islam says that marriage is a divine sign in order that the spouses may find peace and contentment in each other and that love and mercy has been placed between them in its essence marriage is for the benefit of the two people involved creating a tranquil and loving union but its more than that too to get married is to complete half your faith it is part of fulfilling the human mandate and achieving spiritual perfection and only then do we get to procreation as the reason for marriage islam is big on clear solid family structure and children knowing and respecting who their parents are and its also very firm on parents taking clear responsibility for the upbringing and longterm care of their children a few months ago i was rummaging through the fabulous secondhand bookshop barter books in northumberland when my eye was caught as it is want to do since i am a writer with a fascination for love and marriage by a dusty tome entitled wooings and weddings in many climes mainly i love the word wooing and wish we would use it more often i also wish that as a society there was more wooing going on first published in the author travelled through various cultures and brings us stories and pictures of how different peoples engage in marriage particularly good is the one on wigwamland the one constant she is at pains to point out is that marriage flourishes in all contexts this abundance of marriage across time and geography is something that should give weight to this question of what marriage is for and its potential benefits more than a hundred years ago she made an observation that would not be out of place today i have found the marriage customs of most peoples strangely alike and i have found the marriage fact wedlock itself almost identical everywhere the highest of all arts is the art of living with others above all the art of living with those nearest and dearest how many of our children are ever taught its alphabet,2011-02,question marriage idea reason get married express love worse still good kneesup friend modern nonsense love important part marriage sure mandatory prerequisite

in kathleen odonovan was named the first female finance director of btr once the british tyre and rubber company and then one of the uks top public firms such was the significance of her appointment that the financial times carried a large and suitably glamorous picture of ms odonovan on its front page it was regarded as a turning point she would surely be the first of many as the haveitall generation of women stormed the highest echelons of business fast forward years and where are we now there are just five female bosses of ftse companies and three of them are americans who had held boardroom jobs outside the uk we have had endless reports about how to encourage women into the boardroom but still only ftse companies have a female executive director a fulltimer involved in the daytoday running of the business there is a more liberal sprinkling of nonexecutives that is parttime independent directors who monitor management and represent shareholders but still of the top firms have not a single woman sitting at the boardroom table the situation is worse outside the top where the pressure to conform to corporate governance standards is higher far worse in the next largest companies there are just executive directors a paltry of the total yesterday the latest women in the boardroom report written by former banker lord davies of abersoch said ftse firms should set a target of by the next should set themselves a relevant target for their industry and frankly do their best to meet it what happens if they dont a threat of legislation to impose quotas which would require yet more reviews by the time its likely to become law another generation of female workers will have been passed over the fact is that quotas are the only way to force change for two decades i would have argued against such a move but no longer almost every senior woman in business disagrees quotas would devalue womens achievements and so on and on although it is hard for instance to detect any sign of guilt among mps who are in parliament because of womenonly shortlists the argument against quotas from those women who have clawed their way to the top is always that nothing stopped them from making it to the boardroom it is not a case of pulling up the drawbridge to stop other women following they wont lower it either for those following behind and help correct a situation that is clearly wrong and this is despite the fact that there is plenty of evidence that putting women on boards correlates with better business performance headhunters whose senior ranks are full of women are equally to blame why dont they look beyond the usual suspects or are they too busy kowtowing to the chairmen paying their fees one huge opportunity for change was missed by another woman in laura dandrea tyson an economist and former adviser to bill clinton was asked by corporate governance guru sir derek higgs to compile a list of women who would make good nonexecutive directors for big firms after months of procrastination she produced not a single name it wasnt necessary she said all companies had to do was look a bit harder needless to say they didnt davies wants shareholders to monitor firms to ensure progress is made thats the same shareholders who failed so overtly to hold back the rise in boardroom pay and who were judged by former city minister paul myners to be asleep at the wheel when they were meant to be monitoring the banks there are highprofile backers of quotas the world economic forum at davos imposed a quota on its partner firms this year in a bid to get more female movers and shakers to the davos meeting of business movers and shakers naturally some of the top women there expressed their disdain for the move the norwegian government has imposed a quota on its companies the move has had its critics but guess what norwegian business has not crumbled and christine lagarde the french finance minister also made it clear recently that talking hasnt solved anything and quotas are the only answer even the threat of quotas in the uk has been having an impact in recent months with the davies report looming one in three nonexecutive appointments has been a woman davies has missed his chance to make a step change without quotas there is just too big a risk that the next years will be just like the last,2011-02,kathleen odonovan wa named first female

the question what is marriage for the question has always been less what is marriage for than what do people use it for and it is fairly clear from some of the discussion here that part of what people use it for is to convince themselves that they and their relationships are in some special and transcendent way better than other peoples there is a name for that and it is spiritual pride and just because i dont happen to believe in god any more doesnt mean that i think it not sinful perhaps but deeply unhealthy and divisive its clear for example that for a lot of people marriage is a way in which the state and the church reward them for happening to be heterosexual which let us be clear is no less a valid lifestyle choice because it happens at present to be a majority one to go further as both harriet baber and austen ivereigh appear to and argue that marriage should be monogamous lifelong and with no time off for good behaviour is already to ignore the reality of what actually happens in the society we live in to argue as ivereigh explicitly does that marriage should be restricted to heterosexual couples is implicitly to argue that it should be restricted to couples that know in advance whether through deeply held religious conviction or some kind of existential leap in the dark that they will never divorce or commit adultery even in their hearts this is horribly unforgiving to the ordinary messy muddle of human lives on the one hand and on the other assumes that lesbian and gay couples never feel that overarching sense of permanence to their relationships there is a reason why society and many of the churches have chosen to relax their sense of what marriage is from this spurious gold standard and that reason is that the history of trying to maintain it is a history of cruelty the imprisonment and medical torture of lgbt people the stigmatisation of unmarried mothers and their children the expectation that those who do not fit that standard go without sexual expression or family life one of the things i find myself compelled to say to those who not only believe that their relationships are better than other peoples but want the laws of god and men to give them a gold star is just this have you no shame have you no sense of guilt about what was done in your name in the past and continues to be done elsewhere there is a further paradox to the position that marriage is special and forever i do not see the proponents of this position rushing to defend the marriages of trans people who wish to preserve their existing relationships at present in order to have their gender recognised posttransition men and women have to sever existing ties and only afterwards sometimes within days contract a civil partnership with their husband or wife does it have to be spelled out how humiliating and demeaning and costly this is the advocates of marriage as a special status will further say that it is the best way to bring up children this might or might not be the case but the constant disadvantaging or at best disparagement by politicians clerics and parts of the press of the children of single parents unmarried heterosexuals or lesbian and gay unions means that there is no level ground on which that judgement can reliably be made growing up with parents who are deeply unhappy with each other or try constantly to live up to an unrealistic expectation of who they ought to be has as many negative consequences as a constant rackety parade of parents friends lovers and pickups just different ones as tolstoy remarked all happy families are alike and every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way but he did not mean by this that happiness is the product of a cookie cutter or a straightjacket if we are committed to the idea that people should have equal rights no one should be considered a first or secondclass citizen peter tatchells argument that the availability of marriage andor civil partnerships on an equal basis is a human right is a logical and consistent one there are of course other arguments for equal marriage that are less persuasive andrew sullivans argument that marriage equality is a way of detaching lesbians and gay men from bohemia and giving them a stake in bourgeois society being the most common one the job of the state is to help people live out their lives with an equal chance it is not to help chivvy them into being as alike as possible nor to assist those who want to do this on grounds on which even the religious do not agree,2011-02,question marriage question ha always less

jacqui smith the former home secretary who stepped down after making an expenses claim for two adult movies ordered by her husband is to present porn again a documentary exploring the porn industry in a radio interview smith claims not to have realised porn on the internet was so ubiquitous one can only assume she and her husband have had their safesearch filter on all these years the internet is awash with porn but then its the internet its awash with many things smiths concern that unregulated widespread availability of adult material means people of all ages can look at porn day in day out for hours on end ignores the fact that most people have jobs to attend lives to lead or homework to do and that hours of pornwatching would be pretty damn boring smiths sentiment typifies the think of the children scaremongering which seeks to construct an adult morality around the need to protect the innocent and to deny adults the right to act as adults making adult choices and what might happen if people watched porn for hours on end the implication is that this would be personally harmful and socially destabilising a conclusion based in part on the notion that sexual pleasure is inherently corrupting a great deal of lazy thinking myth making poor research and anecdotal evidence surrounds debates on the sex industry a recent cambridge debate asking does pornography provide a good public service saw prominent antiporn campaigner gail dines taken to task for supporting her argument with shoddy stats from unreliable sources the lilith report of used inaccurate statistics to conclude that an increase in lapdancing clubs in camden led to an increase in rape the report challenged by brooke magnanti remains influential presumably because to many people it sounds right in the arguments for and against porn those critical of the industry claim porn is violent and degrading towards women and that those involved are often trafficked or working under duress pornography like any multibillion dollar industry has its dark corners but many of the antiarguments are centred on and gain credence from the belief that women prefer not to have sex that we do not have sexual autonomy and agency that women in porn are only ever coerced into being there on the other side of the debate theres often an uncritical examination of available porn and a failure to campaign for better more inclusive porn as jacqui smith has discovered the internet offers a wide range of pornography catering for many tastes itll be interesting to see if smith in talking to feminists is talking to feminists both for and against porn and to feminist producers of porn undoubtedly the bulk of porn is aimed at the straight male market but an increasing number of women are watching porn too today is lady porn day an initiative by blogger rabbit white promoted via twitter to highlight how women are excluded as consumers of porn and to explore what we want from our stroke material i dont know what conclusions smith will reach in her documentary but from her reassurances that her husband hasnt watched porn since the expenses scandal it doesnt sound as if shes turned into a proporn advocate ours is a culture in which sex is the enemy in which fear prejudice and presumption inform legislation we have the notoriously vague extreme porn laws that saw a man in court defending himself against charges of possessing an obscene video featuring tony the tiger from the frosties ad we have ed vaizey wanting porn sites to be blocked again for the sake of the children its a shame smith couldnt display a more relaxed tolerant attitude to adult viewing as she says many people dont like the idea of porn yet millions watch it if we could remove some of the shame and stigma attached to watching porn we could maybe escape from the muddled thinking easy bias and misleading figures which clog up explorations of the pros and cons of pornography,2011-02,jacqui smith former

an editorial in this months student bmj says that married people have mortality rates adjusted for age that are to lower than the population as a whole so why is this what are the health benefits surveys of smug marrieds show they are happier healthier and less depressed than those who are unmarried a paper by chris wilson at the university of east anglia suggests the health benefits may be equivalent to giving up smoking while other studies show that married people are less likely to have heart disease cancer liver disease chronic lung disease and even pneumonia and flu marriage has more health benefits for men than women some studies suggest up to five times as much it is worth noting that some studies cant distinguish whether there are real health benefits or whether it is healthier people who marry in the first place why should marriage make you healthier married people tend to be better off than unmarried people so they should be happier financial stress is a cause of mental ill health married people are also less likely to drink heavily smoke take drugs or do other risky things they may also monitor each others health and encourage each other to see the doctor if they feel ill and this may be surprising but married people have more sex than other groups and sex makes you happier and healthier does cohabiting count it does but not to the same extent probably because surveys count living together as meaning anything from trying to save rent by sharing a flat to a couple committed to a lifelong relationship cohabitors tend to drink more than married people and to have lowerquality relationships and a higher incidence of depression what about being in a bad relationship only good marriages improve the health of women but mens mortality rates are lower even in bad ones men who are widowed divorced or single have higher rates of dying from heart disease and lung cancer than married men unhappy marriages make people unhealthy because of the distress they cause a study of women hospitalised for heart disease found that those with unhappy marriages as opposed to those who were either unmarried or happily married were three times more likely to have a repeat episode as you would expect marital rows cause increases in blood pressure but that seems to affect women more than men,2011-02,editorial month student bmj say married people mortality rate

the question what is marriage for the purpose of marriage is of course security and the freedom that comes with security marriage liberates us from the meat market for married people sex is readily available so we can relax and enjoy our free time doing what we please we dont have to go out and hustle to hook up marriage is also a financial cushion if we lose our jobs our partners can carry us until we get work again or support us while we learn new skills this is especially important in the us where unemployment benefits are meagre and in most states run out after weeks marriage is economically advantageous marriage partners can bootstrap up putting one another through school and if necessary supporting one another through spells of unemployment and retraining best of all marriage is a legal contract it locks in relationships marriage partners cannot be dumped without hassle and expense it frees us from the stressful exhausting business of courtship from working to charm and ingratiate ourselves from dressing grooming and tedious seduction routines we can let ourselves go pig out and enjoy life security liberates us lots of people particularly here in the us think security is a bad thing government employees with secure positions they complain are lazy and waste taxpayers money employees in the private sector have to perform because they can easily be fired courting couples are romantic attentive to one another and eager to please married men secure in their relationships ignore their wives and married women get fat whether in our personal or professional lives market discipline competition and fear keep us lean mean and on our toes when downsizing firms started laying off whitecollar employees cheerleaders told american workers that it was the best thing that could happen to them conventional careers would be a thing of the past everyone would be a consultant doing limitedterm projects for one firm after another it would be endlessly exciting and in the process we would become lifelong learners we would learn how to pick up new skills on the fly adjust to new corporate cultures and bond with new work teams above all we would learn to sell ourselves to keep our rsums up to date network and package ourselves effectively for all the excitement the opportunity costs of this arrangement are significant the key to german economic success the chancellor angela merkel remarked was we still make things in the us we are preoccupied with making and selling ourselves selfsalesmanship is timeconsuming and the expertise we develop in packaging ourselves does not contribute to gdp courtship is timeconsuming too and expensive it may be fun for a little while but after a week or two you want to get back to your work and usual pastimes there are just so many tte tte dinners sensuous soaks together in the hot tub and spontaneous al fresco sex episodes a person can take you dont want to spend the rest of your life courting or hustling for a hookup or endlessly working on your relationship you want that relationship squared away so that you dont have to bother about it and can get on with your life just as you want job security so that you can work at your job rather than working at your wardrobe contacts database and rsum ive been married for years and tenured since i love my husband and children love my

the spotlight of public attention is on one of its regular sweeps over women in management this week a city figure comes out against quotas as a way of increasing the proportion of women in the boardroom lord davies of abersoch commissioned by the government to recommend action to raise the number of female directors in top companies wants monitoring and transparency a second report will probably show that women just arent trying to get the top jobs for another of the weeks headlines is that women are selflimiting lack of confidence and ambition not a lack of opportunity the institute for leadership and management says explains why barely one in eight directors of ftse companies are women but here is the odd one out an lse report earlier this month found that nearly threequarters of women under anticipate starting their own business put the three reports together and maybe a truer picture of what is going on will emerge first quotas are not the whole answer in pioneering norway the number of women directors has fallen back from nearly half to less than amid reports that quotas have led to personally damaging appointments some women labour mps might sympathise with the nightmarish consequences of being propelled into highvisibility highrisk roles with inadequate preparation and a noisy mob willing you to fail but they should be consoled by the evidence that quotas have also been transformative they have broken a vicious circle theresa may and yvette cooper can take each other on across the dispatch box without anyone discussing their appearance hardly a final victory but politics is at last beginning to look like a suitable job for a woman lord daviess reasons for rejecting quotas it appears are based on company hostility that is hardly surprising companies want women who behave like men they cannot imagine a world organised differently from the one they see around them now equally many talented women see no reason to tolerate the brutally individualistic environment of many city firms if that is the only measure of success on offer it might explain why women told the ilm survey that they were not ambitious until they have the space to show that different ways of working can be equally or more successful they are unlikely to fight for the right to be on the board instead as the lse report found women are increasingly choosing to control their working environment and set their own standards of success by running their own show that does not look like a reluctance to take risks or a lack of ambition but rather a determination

valentines day is my anniversary it is the day that i awoke after being drugged and raped if the gops new jersey congressman chris smith had his way the proposed no taxation for abortion act would limit the rape exemption for abortion to forcible rape that would mean that all victims of statutory rape date rape rape of the mentally incapacitated and rape in instances where one is drugged or given excessive amounts of alcohol would no longer be allowed certain legal protections for the gop this is an abortion issue for the opposition and victims like me this is about much more my intention is to make fellow columbia students and others more aware of rape as a social legal and individual problem the national institute of justice nij and centres for disease control amp prevention cdc report that one in six women has been raped or has been the victim of attempted rape in her lifetime yet only of victims in the us report it most rapes are not reported because women feel embarrassed or ashamed carol sher director of beth israels rape crisis center attributes this to the hazy memories victims experience because they are drugged or given an excess of alcohol for me panic set in shock took over i was physically sick and in denial but with the support of family and friends i was in the emergency room hours later and hours after the rape they had examined me collected evidence and i had filed a police report but by then precious evidence had been lost alcohol and ghb a commonly used date rape drug are not detectable in the system after eight hours according to the nij and cdc of reported rapists are arrested or detained of the victims that report the rape are referred to a prosecutor and of victims reported that the police did nothing i began my own dismal tour through our citys justice system as the cocktail of drugs i was given to prevent sexually transmitted disease began making me violently nauseous the police drove me to the bronx special victims unit since rape charges must be filed in the city borough where the rape occurs they put me in the back of their patrol car which made me feel like a criminal speaking to the detective was comforting yet unnerving he informed me that it was not uncommon for women to report being drugged and raped waking up in the bronx only remembering that they had last been out in manhattan with friends the night before after reporting the few things that i could remember from the night before and the visual details i gathered immediately after i awoke the detective said he was more than sure he knew who the perpetrator was a convicted felon and finally some relief swept over me i identified my attacker in a police lineup the next morning the prosecutor i was then referred to openly encouraged me to give up or file misdemeanor charges i pressed felony charges because i wanted my attacker punished to the full extent of the law carrying a rape case through the legal system is a discouraging process in which you feel ignored and uncomfortable and yet are forced to make important decisions while under duress and sleepdeprived it is also a disrupting process requiring time off from work for the numerous court dates and appointments that must be scheduled in the borough where the charges are filed often requiring the victim to travel long distances and go it alone there were many times when i wanted to give up go home and crawl into bed but friends stayed by my side i wondered what less educated women women who had children and women whose employers are not as understanding did under such circumstances i am single and my boss was sympathetic and gave me paid time off thankfully i also had an educated friend by my side and we had a network of professional lawyer friends who interrupted business meetings and depositions to advise me in the short time i was given to decide if i would file misdemeanor or felony charges if the victim does not press felony charges they cannot have hospital charges medication and therapy costs covered they cannot recover lost wages nor will they be eligible to file a restraining order it was a risk it is the rapists word against yours if you lose he goes free and you have no legal right to request a restraining order no evidence from the rape kit was ever presented in my case i lost i moved because i no longer felt safe in my home one month later i was accepted as a student to columbia university for now the current classification of rape is safe from congressional revision after heavy criticism from advocacy groups such as moveonorg emilys list and twitters dearjohn campaign the language of forcible rape will be kept out of the gops proposed bill but there is still much work to do on the local level to assist rape victims to ensure timely testing of all rape kits and to bring these criminals to justice and for our student community at columbia we are a community many of us in a strange place and far from home be safe take care of each other especially when you are out drinking with friends know your rights and be informed of your options in the unfortunate event that you or someone you know

its national marriage week apparently life is just one long honeymoon i cant say its affected me much because every week is bleedin national marriage week as far as i can tell promoting the idea of marriage as a dream of sexual and emotional fulfilment is the white noise of our culture when my eldest was a toddler she put on a white crash helmet and went round shouting i want to be dried i want to be dried was she mentally disturbed she meant bride as it turned out where did she get this information from i asked desperately because i did not exactly live in a world of white weddings its just there said a wise woman kids pick up these things through osmosis nonetheless iain duncan smith the archbishop of canterbury the chief rabbi and anne atkins among others got themselves to the palace of westminster to inspire us to get married and even better to stay married what a palaver if marriage is so damn wonderful why does any institution or faith or government need to prop it up explain commitment or reward us with tax breaks surely a good marriage is its own reward but not in a material world and thats what its about there remains a huge demand from the right that the state do more to support marriage those who fetishise tax breaks for marriage are often the same people who want the state to keep its nose out of our personal lives as we know david cameron believes in less state and more society big society or high society or something the problem is really low society where people breed for benefits when i say people i mean women who get impregnated and then marry the state i married the state once myself predictably it didnt last so i ended up divorcing it and got a job no one denies there are massive flaws with the benefit system though the amount that benefit fraud costs is as nothing compared to corporate fraud having raised the problem of broken britain the solution is vaguely big society or more specifically big marriage tory doctrine remains in peculiar denial about what causes the broken families they so abhor there are two separate issues one concerns the people who dont get married in the first place the other is divorce duncan smith has met some poor people and has seen that there is little reason for women to stay with men who have no work and contribute little generations of workless males mean at best men are treated as an extra more burdensome child the obvious answer is to provide training and jobs that give young fathers a sense of responsibility however as a carrot this idealised state of marriage cant work when the raw marriage material is nonexistent so we get the stick benefit cuts to women and children marriage is the glue that should paper over the cracks in this system but how can it the tory concept of marriage is over determined as a marxist might say but marriages fail not because people have read the communist manifesto bourgeois marriage is in reality a system of wives in common but because the expectations we heap on to it both personally and politically are ludicrous when marriage was viewed as an economic and sexual transaction largely related to property no one expected it to embody lifelong friendship and sexual passion the idea of a joint loving companionate partnership is relatively new yet it is what most people seek strangely enough some of the weddings i have been to lately have been those of people who have been living together for many years with their children and do the deal precisely to avoid complications around property rights in the event of their deaths its lovely to see people go the distance of course but its also miserable to see people stuck in unhappy marriages when my own split apart i was shocked at the number of people who wanted to tell me how awful their seemingly ok relationships were they were only together because of the children they had outgrown each other they had affairs they never had sex or indeed hardly communicated at the same time the number of younger people still prepared to jump into marriage stuns me on this point i agree with duncan smith the amount people spend on weddings is insane and i speak as someone who enjoys a party a drink and a cry nonetheless younger colleagues spend their entire summers going to weddings buying into the traditional package the homogenous hen nights and gormless stag dos appear joyless but then if you believe this actually is your last night of freedom i suppose it is freedom is of course code for anything other than prescriptive monogamy the reality is that many lead lives of serial monogamy or simply turn a blind eye to each others affairs until they dont as well as the worried well there is now a burgeoning market for those i call the worried married who may not be so smug after all things just arent as they were kids get in the way the relationship has to be worked on via the medium or tedium of minibreaks and lingerie you see these couples in every idyllic holiday setting the world over sitting with nothing to say to each other on a show about teenage sex the other night an yearold was talking about how passion had dimmed after a year with her bloke what hope is there for the rest of us but sexual satisfaction is hardly part of the emotional and economic equation the tories are making theirs is a marriage of fiscal and social conservatism veiled with concern for children the only problem is these pesky women who refuse to stay trapped in marriages if they can afford to leave it was not so long ago that the sanctity of marriage was preserved not by love but by fear fear of poverty fear of shame and blame yet it is not demands of women that have undermined marriage but the more everyday demands of needing two incomes which is a huge pressure for families the great majority of our million single parents didnt plan to end up this way and would have preferred to keep their marriages intact the question is not whether i believe in marriage which is like asking whether i believe in mortgages they exist the question is whether you believe in yours if so fantastic lucky you why punish those who dont make that choice or whose choices dont work out if the issue is literally children then support for single parents should be paramount but thats not what is happening is it instead we have a discourse of morality to counter material reality poverty the romance that has brought us to our knees is the one between the adulterous city and cuckolded politicians a marriage of convenience if ever there was one a match made in hell as it turns out so lets get it straight the dire state of the economy has nothing to do with whether people cohabit or not coupling and uncoupled leave us alone,2011-02,national marriage week

tougher measures to prevent people being unfairly prosecuted for retracting rape claims have been unveiled and prosecutors given new guidance on how to handle cases cases where rape allegations may have been true including rape claims made by women suffering from domestic violence are unlikely to be prosecuted according to the rules set out by the director of public prosecutions keir starmer these are very difficult cases which require us to explore surrounding circumstances such as history of abuse and not to treat at face value the idea that the allegations have been made up said starmer our interim guidance aims to protect individuals who retract a truthful allegation as a result of pressure of fear of violence while taking a firm approach to those who make a malicious allegation against an innocent person the move follows a number of highprofile cases in which women who had been raped were sent to jail for changing their minds about giving evidence against their accuser after being charged with perverting the course of justice in december starmer said that he would personally need to approve prosecutions brought in rape retraction cases the new guidelines which are being accompanied by a threemonth public consultation would not remove the need for the dpps approval starmer said i have had a number of cases since december which are complex and sensitive they are very difficult and there are rarely any easy answers starmer said i will keep the role of personally approving these cases until the consultation is over last year a yearold woman was sentenced to eight months in prison after she retracted an allegation despite the court accepting that she had suffered prolonged domestic abuse and had backed down from the rape complaint under pressure from her husband the woman was freed by the court of appeal after lord judge the lord chief justice said there should be a broad measure of compassion for women who had already been victimised she would not have been prosecuted under the new guidance in england and wales about people are prosecuted for perverting the course of justice each year no figures are available for people who are charged after retracting allegations of rape and domestic violence campaigners welcomed the decision to create guidelines but questioned whether they would be sufficient to protect victims its all very well to put out guidelines but both police and prosecutors have done so before over the years and we dont feel that investigations and prosecutions have substantially improved said lisa longstaff at women against rape the real question is what happens in practice and what do they propose to do about negligent and biased police and prosecutors so far this issue has not been addressed although the guidelines would make prosecutions less likely in future cases they are not expected to help women who are already serving prison sentences for perverting the course of justice following rape cases when we issue policy guidance we dont look back through records and go through hypothetical exercise what the outcome would have been if the guidance had been in place starmer said,2011-02,tougher measure prevent people unfairly prosecuted retracting rape claim unveiled prosecutor given new guidance handle case case rape allegation may true including rape claim made woman

iain duncan smith loves statistics about marriage in particular these ones people who marry are more like to stay together and if they split up they are less likely to do so while their children are young they are more resilient to the slings and arrows of financial fortune the poorest of married couples are more stable than all but the richest of cohabiting couples one in five sets of cohabiting parents split up before their children are three years old compared with one in twenty sets of parents who are married sceptics of the marriage argument always say that this talk stigmatises parents they often condemn it as patronising edwardian drivel tm nick clegg they regularly say that the figures dont reflect other social factors but what i always find myself screaming at the radio is that this is a selfselecting sample married people stand up and say they want to be together for ever it is a cornerstone of their identities to be in this permanent and nontransferable union and then were surprised when they stay together its like being surprised when somebody signs up for a marathon then puts on some shorts and runs a really long way nonmarried couples might choose not to marry for any of a number of reasons some people just arent that committed to each other some people dont think a permanent marital unit is the only way to raise children having been raised unhappily in one or happily outside one some people and they arent necessarily delinquent think it very unlikely that two people will across a course of decades change in the same direction at the same pace so the very act of bonding them is an act of enslavement for one if not both some people think that without a religious foundation marriage has no import beyond a burst of optimism thats what i think this consideration wouldnt actually stop me getting married but if i were to marry it would be for the kneesup and i wouldnt be carrying into it the cargo of duty honour and immutability that duncan smith for instance carried into his that doesnt mean i have no sense of responsibility and permanence simply that they are attached to things other than the ring that isnt on my finger in terms of whether you have a right to introduce children into a union that hasnt been made official id go back to those other factors the institute for fiscal studies has produced the fullest report on this it found that marriage did make a difference to stability but that once you remove factors such as maternal level of education which is hugely influential the job of the father the age of the mother and a variety of characteristics that are in essence mostly subsets or indicators of wealth then marriage doesnt bestow the same quality conservatives argue that you cant strip out those other factors since maybe it was the stability of the home life the marriage itself that led to sound career decisions but none of this matters the question is not does marriage create stable families rather it is can you replicate the stability of marriage with tax breaks or social pressure can you turn people who arent the marrying sort into people who wont divorce the first answer is that not even the staunchest conservative would sign up to a tax allowance that would cover the cost of the average wedding which is k so even if bribery did work its not affordable duncan smith has an answer to this weve got to get away from film stars soap stars pop stars and football stars what has changed has been the hellostyle idea that if you get married and cant show yourself in a hello light then somehow you are a bit of a failure marriage he reminds us is about hard graft and putting yourself second poached salmon and table posies do not prepare you for that you would be better off in a harvester im not saying i dont agree i think the wedding industry is absurd as giles fraser the canon chancellor of st pauls cathedral said last year at least with a funeral you get dignity and seriousness weddings are just taffeta and ego but i wonder what it would do to duncan smiths statistics if we all did suddenly decide to get married for less than the proposed tax relief a year part of the selfselection of married people is that they have saved up andor borrowed from parents andor gone into further debt for a lavish statement of their loving intent nobody goes into that lightly a pub lunch on the other hand you could enter into quite merrily and more than once even if you could pay people to marry those who are prepared to do it for the money will not view it with the seriousness that keeps married people together this is so screamingly obvious that duncan smith must be aware of it and the stated points of his argument are irrelevant its just a fig leaf of text to cover his subtext which is to try and rebuild the taboo around cohabiting couples by making them the aberration rather than the alternative this thankfully is never going to work trying to remake a taboo is like trying to unscramble an

living as a woman was just a starting point as soon as i entered the nhs pathway and began the real life experience i had to ask myself what sort of woman establishing this involved rethinking my relationship with the vague social construct of masculinity and separating those traits which had been a facade to help me pass as male before transition from those integral to my character simultaneously whilst i knew that changing my body carried no obligation to adopt any socially gendered behaviours presenting as female made it prudent to at least consider my ideas of femininity and how feminine i wished to be i wrote when discussing passing that gender roles are like languages with men expected to speak or perform their version of masculinity and women femininity those who dont talk like natives invariably stand out transsexual women werent raised with femininity as their language or to express themselves in a feminine manner and in a world that often warns those born male against any display of femininity from a young age and in which those adjudged to get it wrong can be ruthlessly attacked this can be a problem unlike languages which have concrete rules gender is often defined as much by what it isnt as what it is and learned by doing beginning transition i thought more about what it meant to be a woman and the social inequalities that may come with being femalebodied than what contemporary society deemed to be feminine the two were not inherently linked and focusing too much on appearance and demeanour seemed to me a red herring in clothing i naturally leant more towards femme styles which just meant that i tended to wear dresses and skirts on formal occasions more than trousers otherwise i considered gender presentation primarily when i was told to this feedback gradually changed the way i dressed and behaved just as my peers had criticised me pretransition when they deemed my demeanour insufficiently masculine so my female friends now advised me when they thought my clothes or conduct inappropriately unfeminine of course femininity is not solely about external things clothes cosmetics or posture but by definition they are the most obvious manifestations of individual attitudes towards gender roles and getting them conspicuously wrong can have real social consequences i was fortunate enough to make my worst aesthetic errors in my early twenties before i started transition and when i began living as female fulltime i was cautious doing most clothes shopping with friends who i knew would tell me if i fell into the trap of dressing too young or too old for my age or in noticeably outmoded styles i was particularly wary of this because of the stereotype that persists about trans women and not just in reactionary circles criticising us for conforming to conservative models of femininity besides mentioning that it rests on the assumption that femininity is reactionary in itself which julia serano for example debunks its worth considering how this functions on a practical level many transsexual women are most visible when they start transitioning becoming less conspicuous and thus unnoticed by those looking for hyperfemininity in order to reaffirm their prejudices gradually they find a style that suits them amid a number of conflicting pressures when made by women this particular attack tends to come through hostile generalisations made in purely theoretical realms ive never had such a critique expressed to me personally by any female ive met often these writers such as that cited above from the s oscillated between blaming the gender identity clinics and their patients for the way they believed transsexual women to present themselves however they are long behind the contemporary reality in the past certain gics did make rigorous rather conservative demands of their patients gender presentations but theyve gradually moved beyond this incidentally have you ever heard anyone male or female criticise a transsexual man for conforming to masculine stereotypes by say wearing jeans and having stubble no me neither in any case these theories became academic soon after i started living as female the abuse from men if i overplayed my femme appearance caused far more concern coming as street harassment with violent undertones the thought process behind what i initially cast as transphobia but soon recognised as hatred and fear of femininity was so transparent that i could picture it as a flowchart unavoidably this also changed the way i presented but with experience i found modes of selfexpression for different occasions that felt right for me i wont say i feel feminine or i feel like a woman because besides the nebulousness of such statements it would put me in league with shania twain which would just be awful instead ill simply say that at this point i feel perfectly happy with and proud of my femme identity having found my position on the social construct of femininity amid so many conflicting pressures the same process that any other woman goes through whatever conclusion she comes to only some years later juliet jacquess column appears fortnightly you

alongside the obvious questions of freedom of information and criminal justice the julian assange affair has also made visible a multitude of contemporary anxieties concerning sex and gender this was brought into sharp relief by claims that assanges prospects of a fair trial might be compromised by the possibility that swedens chief prosecutor marianne ny is a malicious radical feminist with a bias against men but what exactly is radical feminism if popular attitudes to feminism are anything to go by its clearly something pretty terrifying research suggests that in the popular imagination the feminist and the radical feminist in particular is seen as full of irrational vitriol towards all men probably a lesbian and certainly not likely to be found browsing in claires accessories as an academic working on issues concerning gender and politics ive had the good fortune of meeting lots of inspiring feminist women and men but despite searching ive yet to locate a feminist matching that particular description perhaps i havent looked hard enough a more likely possibility is that the popular insistence that radical feminists and often by implication feminists in general are all manhaters reflects wider misunderstandings about the history of feminism and its impact on contemporary gender relations so what is radical feminism historically radical feminism was a specific strand of the feminist movement that emerged in europe and north america in the late s distinctive to this strand was its emphasis on the role of male violence against women in the creation and maintenance of gender inequality as argued by the likes of susan brownmiller andrea dworkin and catherine mackinnon and while a minority of radical feminists most infamously valerie solanas were hostile to men radical feminism was much more instrumental in generating widespread support for campaigns around issues such as rape domestic violence and sexual harassment however in britain at least radical feminism has never been particularly dominant partly because in the eyes of many socialist and postcolonial feminists it has been insufficiently attentive to the intersections between gender inequality and other categories such as race and class so rod liddles peddling of the tiresome rightwing idea that radical feminism has destroyed the family along with dominic raabs assault on feminist bigotry and the vaticans efforts to address distortions caused by radical feminism rest on at least two implausible assumptions first they reduce feminism to a horrifying caricature that never really existed and second they make the frankly bizarre suggestion that radical feminism is the dominant ideology of our times it would seem that not only do these radical feminists commit the outrage of not wearing makeup but they use the time this frees up to consolidate their world domination or an alternative explanation might be that these are the paranoid anxieties of fearful antifeminists their fear is not totally misplaced for radical feminism has undoubtedly had some success fortunately for dominic raab world domination is not one of them three decades ago the notion that rape and domestic violence are pressing political issues rather than trivialities or that men should play an active role in childcare would have been seen by many as radical and dangerous today thanks to the influence of the insights of diverse strands of feminism including but not limited to radical feminism these ideas have seeped into the mainstream despite this genuine gender equality can seem distant but many groups and individuals continue to push in the right direction although the rights and wrongs of the assange affair are at this stage far from clear whenever accusations of manhating feminism enter into a debate our suspicions should be immediately aroused for more often than not the temptation to close down debate by tossing around accusations of manhating radical feminism is caused not by a fear of debate but by the deeper fear that feminism might actually have something important to say,2011-02,alongside obvious question freedom information criminal justice

massively expensive weddings encouraged by a hello magazine celebrity culture are putting pressure on marriage as couples start life together with a large overhang of debt the work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith has warned he said debt was now one of the most prominent causes of family breakdown yet couples were spending the huge sum of on average on their marriage it has become apparent that couples will not marry until they can have such a wedding and some couples will get into debt just to meet the costs duncan smith said at westminster the values of modern society he said were being shaped by the behaviour of film stars soap stars pop stars and football stars what has changed has been the hellostyle idea that if you get married and cant show yourself in a hello light then somehow you are a bit of a failure hello magazine is dominated by photo shoots of celebrity weddings marriage is perhaps the best antidote to the celebrity selfobsessed culture we live in for it is about understanding that our true value is lastingly expressed through the lives of others we commit to what seems to have been forgotten is that the point of marriage is love commitment and creating a safe environment in which to bring up a family a wedding need not cost more than the price of a marriage licence he said duncan smith also said he was going to ensure marital status was reinstated on more government forms looking to see why marriage has been declining as an institution he said guidance councillors say that too many young people have an almost fairytale expectation of life after the marriage ceremony this puts huge pressure on newly married couples as too few have time to develop an understanding of the sacrifices needed to make their relationship work before they break up david cameron was still committed to recognising marriage in the tax system he added but he acknowledged this will face opposition from the liberal democrats who do not wish to be judgmental on how people live their lives the conservatives dropped a preelection policy for a marriage tax break in the face of lib dem opposition he said the tide was turning against those who opposed any mention of the benefits of marriage and insisted he was not involved in any finger wagging we do a disservice to society if we ignore the evidence which shows that stable families tend to be associated with better outcomes for children and there are few more powerful tools for promoting stability than the institution of marriage indeed evidence suggests that even the poorest of married couples are more stable than all but the richest of cohabiting couples fiona weir chief executive of single parent group gingerbread said at a time of significant financial hardship when many families are experiencing poverty introducing a tax break for marriage would be a shockingly unfair use of government funds modelling by the institute for fiscal studies shows that this would cost the state at least bn a year the majority of britains million single parents were previously married and expected their families to stay intact and single parents consistently tell us that marriage tax proposals

marriage is the best antidote to the selfobsessed celebrity culture of modern life the cabinet minister iain duncan smith will say as he presses the case for promoting marriage to ward off family breakdown today duncan smith a longterm proponent of the benefits of marriage to prevent social problems will deliver a speech as part of marriage week uk in which he will dismiss as absurd and damaging the suggestion that voicing support for marriage stigmatises single people and cohabitees launching marriage week in the house of commons later today the work and pensions secretary will argue that the government is right to help couples overcome barriers to tying the knot by offering financial support citing research indicating that while as many as of young people aspire to marry some hold back for financial reasons family breakdown is not only damaging for individuals it also imposes incredibly high financial and social costs on society as a whole duncan smith will argue he will contrast the awards and praise lavished on pop stars celebrities actors footballers and even politicians with the most basic institution which nurtures each generation and from which so many of us draw our strength and purpose going unnoticed and unrewarded fashionably dismissed or taken for granted the commitment of two people to put selfish interest to one side for the sake of each other and the children they raise is simply the very best of us as human beings duncan smith will say furthermore marriage is perhaps the best antidote to the celebrity selfobsessed culture we live in for it is about understanding that our true value is lastingly expressed through the lives of others we commit to the conservative minister will dismiss the claim that the prospect of government cash would make no difference to a couples decision on whether to marry while duncan smith will say the state should not lecture or push people to marry he will insist it is quite legitimate to offer financial support to those who do research by the centre for social justice thinktank has found that a majority of people out of work or in parttime work think lowearning and unemployed people are better off living apart than as a couple only those with money say it has no bearing on whether people stay together duncan smith will say adding that is why we are investing m in relationship support and are committed to reducing the couple penalty plans to offer tax breaks for married couples was a conservative manifesto commitment in the runup to the general election at the time the idea was panned by the liberal democrat leader nick clegg as patronising drivel that belong in the edwardian age the coalition agreement makes clear that liberal democrat mps can abstain in any vote on the issue with david cameron intending to press ahead with the change duncan smith will say over the years the political establishment has frowned if a mainstream politician mentions marriage the prevailing view was that to extol the virtues of this most fundamental institution somehow meant that you were going to stigmatise those who were not married this is an absurd and damaging assumption government must understand the effect that family breakdown can have on the wellbeing of both adults and children the financial costs of family breakdown are incredibly high but what is most painful to see is the human cost the wasted potential the antisocial behaviour and the low selfesteem the organisers of marriage week are calling on couples community groups and companies to celebrate romance

here we go again for years various organisations lawyers bishops and lords included have tried to establish legal rights for cohabitees on every occasion the dont put marriage in peril band have unfairly won the day making more children vulnerable to life on the breadline on this occasion nicholas wall the head of the family law division has said that unmarried partners should be given the right to each have an equitable share of assets and money should their relationship break down wall told the times women cohabitees in particular are severely disadvantaged by being unable to claim maintenance and having their property rights determined by the conventional laws of trusts wall said that in one recent case a house was bought by an unmarried couple jointly they had lived together for years and had two children and the judge divided to the man and to the woman we in the court of appeal reversed it and said it should be the case is now going to the supreme court resolution an organisation of family lawyers can point to any number of cases of women and men who have found themselves after years of cohabiting with no money and no roof over their heads and those of their children after a separation trust is fine when cupid is still firing his arrows but once the end is in sight or one half of the cohabiting couple dies if the mortgage is in only one name the other person could find themselves without a home or a share of a pension and assets britain has more than million cohabiting couples commonlaw marriage was abolished in the s but according to a british social attitudes survey many believe it is alive and well of people cohabited in the s now at least of us cohabit before or without marriage cohabitation is associated with higher levels of fragmentation while of couples split before their child is five that compares with of those who are married but if critics of cohabitation rights really want to boost marriage the best path is one of

education and may have a faith linda waite and maggie gallaghers book the case for marriage why married people are happier healthier and betteroff financially uses studies to prove exactly what they proclaim in the title what the two dont tackle nearly so well is the chickenandegg dilemma namely does marriage make people happier and healthier or is it the happy healthy people who tend to get married if the answer is the latter cohabitation rights arent going to make much different to the state of our nuptials many who cohabit say they dont marry because they lack prospects and the money for a proper wedding and house or the man doesnt have a wage others cohabit because one partner wont commit to marriage some drift into cohabiting so say a girlfriend is chucked out of her flat and temporarily moves in with her boyfriend pays half the mortgage that interim arrangement stretches into a couple of years the relationship breaks up should she then be eligible for half his assets even if there are no children hopefully such a couple would be able to come to their own arrangement but heartbreak can be a vengeful business earlier attempts to improve cohabitation rights and the rights of dependents living together for instance two sisters suggested a minimum of two or five years cohabitation and children having been born to the partnership before a fair division of assets takes place its difficult what if a woman has a child within months of cohabiting and what too of the right to dissent some people cohabit precisely because they want a relationship in which the state and

i appear to have sparked germaine greers tirade against george bernard shaw mrs warrens profession is a wrongheaded trifle that goes clunk clunk clunk january she reports that graduate students at some of our newer universities are writing essays about why is bernard shaw neglected in feminist and gender scholarship and that one essay was sent to her i recently completed a masters in the history of ideas at birkbeck college founded and had sent her my dissertation with this title for comments i wondered if i had been unfair in my criticism of feminist historians for ignoring shaw and in particular of a programme note greer had written in for a national theatre production of mrs warrens profession the first i knew she had received my dissertation was when i read her guardian column greers attack on shaw troubles me she accuses him of having no idea about the miserable lives led by prostitutes shaws notion of prostitution as a distinct career choice made by an adult would have been dispelled by an hours conversation with a gang of fallen women she seems not to have read the preface to mrs warrens profession which explains that the play was written in to draw attention to the truth that prostitution is caused not by female depravity and male licentiousness but simply by underpaying undervaluing and overworking women so shamefully that the poorest of them are forced to resort to prostitution to keep body and soul together she is apparently unaware that shaw wrote that year to the pall mall gazette about the appalling lives of prostitutes plagued by low earnings and fear of physical injury and infection from where i sit greer writes gbs seems less irreverent than irrelevant between and shaw wrote four novels and plays with prefaces most reflect a preoccupation with and a wish to improve the position of women in contemporary society he wrote about the sexual oppression experienced by married women and in favour of the right of unmarried women to have sexual experience and to have children he pointed to poverty as the root cause of prostitution and favoured the state provision of childcare to enable women to work does that sound irrelevant before greer shaws contribution to the feminist cause was widely acknowledged lady rhondda probably the foremost feminist of the interwar years wrote of shaw here is a man who can understand that a woman can be attractive as a person without being concerned with sex and more than that one who can be interested in a woman who is not sexually interesting here in fact is a man whose concern with people of either sex lies in the fact that they are human beings oh marvel greer writes feminists have had about as much time for shaw as he had for them which strikes me as fair enough but given her revelation that she read all his plays at the impressionable age of id suggest the opposite that shaws feminist views did not just anticipate hers but were her inspiration,2011-02,appear sparked germaine greers

call it preadulthood the period between late adolescence and ones late s when there are far more questions than answers jobs and relationships may only be fleeting life particularly for those passing through higher education or in the midst of it will appear to brim with choice and freedom but eventually feel weighted with angst exhaustion and the realisation that any halfway livable existence should be altogether more settled i should know its not that long since i left another thought could women be better at navigating this phase than men bring in a few modern archetypes and see why this might hold true while no end of cultural noise is devoted to twenty and thirtysomething career women making haste in case motherhood brings things to a halt how is it that the most common image of their male contemporaries tends to be silliness ineptitude and too much booze higher female attainment at school is traditionally put down to girls maturing more quickly than boys with the gap closing by university not so in higher education there have long been concerns about a growing gender difference reflected in participation rates and finals results men are more likely to get s and thirds at the last count of young women graduates had failed to find a job and of men the chief executive of the association of graduate recruiters credits women with being more mature and focused by contrast to quote a us writer might it be that millions of young men have yet to be more than giant frat boys maladroit geeks or unwashed slackers those words along with the term preadulthood come from a new book called manning up subtitled how the rise of women has turned men into boys by the conservative polemicist kay s hymowitz us publishing seems to produce these breathlessly written often maddening texts by the score but this one picks apart something that has been bugging me for years a suspicion that my generation blazed a trail for a newly puerile kind of masculinity that has been locked into millions of lives i hit my s as preadulthoods basics were being identified and socalled laddism was at its peak i recognise hymowitzs picture of the angloamerican culture it spawned childman icons such as adam sandler and owen wilson and malefronted tv shows top gear obviously that wink at contemporary mans shallowness and puerility as if the dudes know full well just how ridiculous they are reading her book i even started to wonder if the failure of modern male politicians to exude the authority of their predecessors might be down to the malaise she describes witness the noticeable decline in the tone of pmqs once david cameron got involved usually put down to his etonian flashman tendencies though perhaps just as traceable to a male generation for whom crass mockery is much more ingrained than elegant repartee that said im not sure about her implication that inside every man is a semiferal ubermensch who needs an outlet better surely to encourage an updated version of the new man wiped out in the backlash against the righton s though she cites evidence that female graduates are outearning male contemporaries in some us cities but not it has to be said in the uk her picture of an insurgent postfeminist sisterhood bumps up against the gender pay gap and the inability of most industrial economies to know what to do about motherhood but there is something in her conviction that among the vociferous middle class at least one result of the embrace of female empowerment has been a dangerous downgrading of men particularly when it comes to the importance of fatherhood from that a lot follows if youre writing dads out of the script via blithe claims that their role is overrated and the celebration of reproductive independence for the rich at least dont be surprised if educated male thirtysomethings remain stubbornly dissolute and commitmentphobic and at the more difficult edges of society you sow chaos its also right to wonder about the pernicious effects of tv movies and more and what our publicservice broadcaster is doing funding the rise and rise of clarkson and co right too perhaps to fear the consequences of childmen not just on our screens but in power this is something hymowitz doesnt consider gender inequalities staying much the same and made more toxic by the arrival of a new male elite emerging from extended adolescence even

when you have kids outside wedlock and they stay outside wedlock that looks like a decision it might be a cynical one it is most probably an atheistic one and i cannot rule out the possibility that it speaks of insufficient commitment on the part of one partner or both but at least its something they decided when you have kids outside wedlock and then get married it just makes you look really badly organised thats what id be worrying about if i were ed miliband not is this a votewinner not am i going to lose more single parents than i win rightthinking conservatives not does my bum look politically motivated in this but rather what kind of man does this make of me that i cant even put the points in the right order on my personal life todo list imagine me in government id do everything in the wrong order first id bomb somewhere then id look for a diplomatic solution then id check to see if i could afford it we have to assume that the forthcoming nuptials of miliband and justine thornton are not politically motivated the territory is too vexed for marriage to be a straightforward solution to anything he might conceivably warm the cockles of middle england but i suspect the people who care about this sort of thing care about other things more and dont care at all for a brave new imagining of leftwingery married or not on the other hand thornton could be doing it for her career it is common for lawyers to think that parents who arent married being unable to extract any protection from the law are stupid when you say to them but i dont want to get married they say well thats because youre stupid they might even have rules that forbid you from ascending to qc if you are unmarried on account of your huge stupidity im going to go ahead though and write off career advancement as a motivation its just too late theyre strategic thinkers and they could have leveraged more advantage out of this union at pretty much any time in the past six years than theyre getting now so here are some other possibilities miliband is notoriously countersuggestible he only went to the march on saturday because all his advisers told him not to come on he was speaking fourth in lineup terms that makes him mumford amp sons at the precise moment that the pressure abates and even the most rulebound adviser is saying well you cant get married now it looks like an afterthought thats when he wants to get married now he burns with a love like no other yesterday he could live with her today he cant live without her but really its the zeal of unbelievable stubbornness i have a brother like this most of us do im sure you just want to hope hes not in the same field as you on which note lets imagine that some commentators are right and eds entire life is one long davided tournament in which the prize is always a millimetre out of reach since the true blank is no particular accolade but the annihilation of one brother by the other what has david got left that ed doesnt have a number of improbable plans some spare time in the evenings and a wife this theory will gain credence when ed gets a hair transplant though both mens hair is quite selfdetermining davids is much tuftier it could all be an elaborate ploy to get the kids into a faith school qualifications vary wildly from faith to faith catholics have a points system where the younger your baby was when it was christened the more weighting you get have you ever heard anything more ridiculous in your life than a sixmonthold being more religious than a oneyearold this is a wild stab in the dark but might they be going for a jewish education in which case the heat is totally off the baby and all on justine for an imminent conversion but all religions like you to be married before theyll educate your children it keeps the riffraff out any idiot can get up early on a sunday only people with grand can get hitched ive heard people say that they were able to resist all pressure to marry until their own children started on them and then their resolve evaporated this is impossible at present since their oldest is not yet two but the day is not far away when both scions will be wondering why its fine to be on kids show dramarama justine and lead the opposition ed and yet be way too shy to make a sound commitment to one another in a decent unshowy nottingham

gender split improves innovation in a company while management consultants mckinsey found that companies with more women on their boards outperformed rivals with a higher return on sales a higher

feminism said evangelist and republican broadcaster pat robertson in is a socialist antifamily political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands kill their children practice witchcraft destroy capitalism and become lesbians the feminist retort sorry i missed church i was busy practicing witchcraft and becoming a lesbian has since made its way on to tshirts fridge magnets and bumper stickers where religions concerned maybe robertson was right maybe feminism does lead women to reject traditional religion for our book about the resurgence of feminism in stcentury britain reclaiming the f word the new feminist movement catherine redfern and i surveyed nearly british feminists we wanted to find out who the new feminists were what inspired their engagement with feminism which gender issues they were concerned about and so forth one of our questions was please describe your religious or spiritual views including noneatheistagnostic the wording is worth mentioning since how you ask questions affects the results as debates on the religion question in the census reveal the results show that when compared with the general female population feminists are much less likely to be religious but a little more likely to be interested in alternative or noninstitutional kinds of spirituality when the census asked what is your religion more than three quarters of women said they belonged to a major world religion in the smaller british social attitudes survey which asked the question more openly of women said they regarded themselves as belonging to a religion but in our project only one in identified with a major world religion mostly christianity just over half the feminists said they were either atheist or had no religion one in six was agnostic one in considered themselves spiritual but not conventionally religious and the rest answered in other ways there were a couple of pagan atheists and buddhist christians for instance it seems then that feminism does inspire women to reject religion robertson was worried that feminism was challenging traditional christian values at least values he considered christian many liberals and feminists concerned about the rise of fundamentalism and its erosion of womens rights conclude similarly that feminism and religion have little in common as cath elliott put it whether its one of the worlds major faiths or an offthewall cult religion means one thing and one thing only for those women unfortunate enough to get caught up in it oppression its the patriarchy made manifest maledominated set up by men to protect and perpetuate their power sidestepping the arguments about whether or not religion is irredeemably oppressive to women christina odone has refuted ophelia benson and jeremy stangrooms recent claim that it is its important to ask why feminists think like this is it that they have all undertaken a rational examination of the claims of different religions and found them wanting some of them will no doubt have done this but there are other possible explanations for this feminist antipathy towards religion the first is secularisation in other words the process of religious decline evident in much of europe especially from the latter half of the th century rates of churchgoing are falling and younger people who made up most of our survey participants are especially unlikely to be religious because fewer of them were brought up to be so combine this with the gendered nature of secularisation secularisation confines religion to the private sphere and the family and squeezes religion out from public life and the reasons why feminists are less likely to be religious than other women become clearer feminists challenged the traditional christian discourse that associated femininity with service to family and church feminists argued for womens right to decently paid employment in the public sphere feminists argued that marriage wasnt the beallandendall of a womans life and she should be able to choose whether and when to have children in other words feminists are unlikely to be among the groups of women who are catered for by traditional religious institutions which operate principally in the private sphere women married with children who are not in fulltime employment there is no natural fit between feminists public activist lives and traditional religion the proportion of feminists in our survey who were not heterosexual is high given the tendency of many religious organisations to condemn homosexuality its unlikely that these gay or bisexual feminists would feel at home in them second feminisms intellectual public voice has largely been a secular one as the philosopher rosi braidotti has argued european feminists are heirs to the enlightenment rationalistic critique of religion and socialist feminism with its dismissal of religion was one of the major strands of british feminism in the late s and s even today feminist academics tend to dismiss religion as unimportant and not worth of studying it is likely that this secularism has influenced todays feminists perhaps without them noticing whether this secularism has much to offer the millions of women who are by socialisation or choice religious is a prescient issue that is being raised especially by postcolonial critics third feminists lack of interest in religion is joined by a somewhat increased attraction to alternative or holistic forms of spirituality from yoga reiki and zen meditation to paganism and wicca these forms of spirituality set themselves up as genderequal and this is probably why feminists like them in contrast to the perceived devaluation of womens bodies in traditional religion holistic spiritual practitioners have created female images of divinity developed positive rituals around menstruation and childbirth and given women positions of spiritual authority we need to know far more than a survey can tell us about how religious attitudes are formed to tell whether these hypotheses are accurate in the st century religion has become visible again around the world state approaches to religion and secularism have significant repercussions for religious womens wellbeing so its vital that feminists consider carefully their approaches to religion for other womens sakes if not for their own,2011-03,feminism said evangelist republican broadcaster pat robertson

its the best bit of the paper pamela stephenson connolly gs very own sex therapist answers some remarkable letters every friday we still have fond memories of the woman whose husband wanted her to make animal noises in the bedroom cat dog potbellied pig we never did find out last weeks problem was equally astonishing but not for any nowtsoqueerasfolkness pamelas correspondent a widower in his s wanted some help to find a male friend when my wife was very ill he explained she told me that she would be happy if i had the luck to find a man because i was gay in my teenage years and she thought i would like to renew that experience my late wife understood because she was a lesbian from the age of until we met yes there are arguments to be had about whether you can be gay one moment and not the next whether homosexuality is an experience etc but what struck us was the womans concern for her husband and her lack of jealousy our hearts were lifted at theguardiancomg however causidicus was beside himself how dare the letterwriter feel the need to be discreet about his desires because he was a highly respected person he is patently labouring under the misapprehension that being homosexual is worthy of disapprobation and censure he wrote in the st century assuredly this view is a survival of times past as a gay man who is some years younger than this highly respected sir i would respectfully advise him that he ought to expunge his convictions and holdovers from bygone days and so on and on and on and on by the time comments closed causidicus had had his say times prompting calls of troll in the dungeon abandon thread and this bloody thread isnt about you the other comments the consensus was that causidicus was talking bollocks you have an alarming inability to put yourself in other peoples shoes is how suntoryboss put it perhaps you could try and grasp that what is true for you may not be true for other people that for example perhaps the gentleman in questions friends and social group will be of a similar age to him and not in their s like your friends and that they may be a lot less understanding because of that come monday it was time to pretend to care about the royal wedding again a reader called sonia who clearly reads too many fashion articles wanted to know if anyone really knows what wassername will be wearing when she marries thingumajig hadley freemans answer well no was what it boiled down to the fact is sonia pretty much no one knows anyone who was looking for yet more hype about the happy day must have been disappointed that still wasnt enough for jszepietowski who really gives a damn he wanted to know we are all firefighting while they flaunt unlimited wealth taken from the sweat of the poor nickmavros thought pretty much the same with added emphasis what will kate be wearing she will be dressed in shame if she has any sense of decency people are struggling with their everyday lives while these royal clowns are cavorting around oblivious to the hardships that people are facing lets all follow the lead of hull where no street parties are expected egalitarianism is not compatible with the monarchy talking of the sweat of the poor hardships etc on tuesday patrick kingsley spoke to some of those who will be marching against government cuts tomorrow in what is expected to be the biggest protest since the antiwar march of im going to be there to defend the nhs midwife nora pearce told him ill be with a very large group from kingston hospital and a couple of my grandchildren and well all be carrying two flipping heavy banners at theguardiancomg joedal warned nora to carefully check her placards when a march like this takes place look around at the banners that people are carrying they will be mostly from the extreme left of politics they wont care about you they will only care about causing trouble and marxist theory events like this should be boycotted who is organising this march who is supplying the marshalls who is signing the applications to the council for permission the extreme left the marxisttrotskyiststalinistleninist cabal who dont care about you remember this above all else there was no welfare state in the soviet union libertarianlou had an answer to that and didnt feel the need to raise her voice thats what people were saying about the iraq war protest wasnt it but it turned out to be a mixture of jews christians muslims tories gays straights men women older people kids rich people poor people middleclass people public sector workers businessmen there is quite a lot of political middle ground in between joseph stalin and david cameron just so you know on wednesday jess cartnermorley pondered the decline of the landline at home and at work when i started work she recalls shes if youre wondering you knew everything about the person who sat next to you because they had no choice but to conduct their relationships with their lover their mother their bank manager from their desk phone while you had no choice but to pretend not to listen these days all you overhear is the clatter of typing the lull while they wait for a response and then the rapt concentration when the emailed reply appears i bloody wish said laurenm the woman opposite me is constantly on the phone id love her to email or just stfu visionsofjohanna meanwhile wanted to point out that there was life outside our towns and cities rural areas still rely heavily on landlines i live in london but come from the lake district theyre two different worlds here i

the last public sighting of elizabeth taylor in a gay bar was on thursday september at the abbey in west hollywood the screen icon who had been dubbed the joan of arc of aids in the early s drank a martini and held court with four friends while staff looked after her maltese dog daisy rhinestoneencrusted sunglasses were positioned on her head by another assistant before she was wheeled back through the hushed crowd to a waiting blackedout sedan perhaps the most astonishing detail of this sighting was that a straight woman of still had a favourite gay bar perhaps not it was taylor after all the details of her special relationship with the gay population right up until her death are crucial during the reagan presidency she was the first and most prominent star to align herself with aids fundraising the traction her star wattage lent aids charities turned taylor from a woman who naturally empathised with both the fragility and duality of gay mens political status in the us to a notable force in reversing them at the th international aids conference in she said of the first president bush im not even sure if he knows how to spell aids her public pronouncements on the subject were bluff profound and affecting she raised millions for the last years of her life the fight against aids became a vocation for taylor i hope with all of my heart that in some way i have made a difference in the lives of people with aids she said i want that to be my legacy better that than for the mole on my cheek and still some people wonder why taylor is held in such deep and unique affection by gay men taylors relationship with gay men provided a new model of gay icon no longer was it enough to be a woman with whom gay men retained a bassnote of empathy the kind of strung out glamourtragedy axis that judy garland immortalised taylor made herself useful too you can see parallels of her pioneering work in madonna minogue and the cruder modern public discourse of lady gaga who seems a little overhasty to appoint herself into the role as allow the actual community to anoint her her feeling for camp was not an affectation or strategic marketing device but something more innate and intuitive beneath the artifice the martinis and the rhinestones there was a human heart that many gay men just adored quite unequivocally and with ample reason,2011-03,last public sighting

anna arrowsmith aka anna span has been a porn director for years this made her recent campaign as the liberal democrat candidate for gravesham rather controversial not my cup of tea said nick clegg about her occupation but what she has been doing is not mainstream pornography but independent porn made for women i have fought long and hard for womens right to sexual expression and consumption as well as for freedom of speech she wrote in the observer but gail dines author of pornland how porn has hijacked our sexuality challenged her in the guardian what are you doing that is different from what every other pornographer is doing the best way to answer that question is probably by watching arrowsmiths films and not just hers because a number of women tired of mainstream porn and tired of criticising it without offering an alternative are making the porn films they want to watch these films dont include horny schoolgirls naughty nurses nymphomaniac nannies or desperate housewives nor do they include mafiosi multimillionaires drinking cognac pimps drug dealers or supersized sex machines because these women as filmmakers and consumers place themselves far away from mainstream porn it is a prejudice to say that women dont like porn says erika lust another fem porn director sex images make you hot but pornography has been made by and for men in mainstream porn everything is about male pleasure and women are objects oral sex for men can last forever but when womens turn comes it lasts seconds female orgasms are not an issue in most of the films and women are shown mostly as prostitutes which is sad lust has directed three porn films and written three sex books her website explains we produce adult movies we publish erotic books and magazines our works speak about sex lust and passion we enjoy exciting you and exciting your mind we make love not porn and we do all this with a feminine aesthetic and innovative approach after working for years as a tv producer and director petra joy has moved on to directing artcore films she says women have a lot of catching up to do we had the sex toy revolution first no more giant cucumbers but a goldplated mini vibrator perfect for clit stimulation and now the second wave is the porn revolution porn that is made by and for women that focuses on female pleasure and features male sex objects these directors are just three among many their films have different styles lusts are urban and modern joys are visual and sensory and arrowsmiths are a bit more hardcore but there are similarities that show how this new branch of the porn industry works first of all they are educated lust read political sciences at lund university joy has a masters degree in film history at the university of kln and arrowsmith studied fine art at central saint martins they do this because they chose it and not because they dont have other options they are all independent producers and distribute their films mostly over the internet they pay particular attention to aesthetics music locations actors and stories and most importantly they think about what women need to enjoy porn joy says women enjoy seeing a curve of arousal and like to understand why these people are having sex and how they got turned on women want to see credible female performers women of all sizes and looks who genuinely enjoy themselves rather than porn clones with fake nails hairs and boobs faking it for the camera lust adds to get excited women want to see something that looks like us we want to see independent women exploring their sexuality who are not afraid but are not sex heroines either we want to see attractive men who share our lifestyles our ideas these directors make sure they only work with people who want to perform in erotic films and that what you see is real pleasure lust says i want people with an open sexuality who want to work here i dont want anybody doing this because they dont have another choice during the shooting i want them to have good sex and its my job to find the images for me it is a tense moment because things happen only once and its a moment of hard work is not a party behind the camera in alison lee created the feminist porn awards which this year takes place on april in toronto she says we wanted to celebrate people who were making porn in a feminist way and help to expose them to a greater audience for our sixth anniversary we are expecting lots of stars and a superfun event we are also hoping to have a stronger focus on websites and online porn than we have in the past lust joy and span have previously won awards in different categories this year lust is nominated for her last film life love lust and span for sex experiments bisexual scenes and sex interviews these directors films are also featured on dusk the dutch porn channel that since has broadcast fem porn and is available to m viewers martijn broersma says he started the channel with the aim of providing a service that nobody else was offering nowadays women talk more about their own sexual likes and dislikes he said with this revolution in mind it was logical that women needed their own erotic tv channel and while independent fem porn keeps growing mainstream porn is in crisis patrick kwasniewski specialised in gender and queer studies at the university of klagenfurt and is currently researching his thesis on feminist porn he says the development of this branch of the industry is profiting from the internet the more direct ways to reach consumers easier ways of selfdistribution having a more focused target and producing highly profiled films whilst the mainstream industry faces loss of profits through not changing their traditional ways of production or distribution and producing very repetitive films that have more and more troubles on the market especially when theres so much for free on the internet joy adds the industry is slowly waking up to the fact that it is not just vod video on demand that caused the drop in porn dvd sales but that even males are bored of films that always show the same performers in the same studios going through the same sexual positions in the same running order and looking bored whilst faking it people are hungry for more authenticity variety and joy being part of this industry that refuses to change hasnt always been easy for female porn directors male members of the porn industry dont necessarily like their presence lust says pornographers are usually middleaged straight guys with a similar cultural background they dont like it when i say that i make porn for women they say their porn is for everybody and i am the tight one but i just cant have an intellectual discussion with them because they dont measure up what im doing is criticising the kind of porn they have been making for years and offering an alternative there are no reliable figures on female porn audiences but there are some academic studies that provide some information verena chiara kuckenberger is responsible for gender at the university of graz and she did a study on womens porn that included audience research she says research suggests that women are not as interested in pornography as men are but this assumption has to be seen in a broader context there are certain scripts for male and female sexuality and one of these says that women dont find pleasure in looking as man do but who looks and who gets looked at is a question of power as well historically the gaze is male while women are objects that are being looked at for women to admit to experiencing pleasure in watching pornography means overcoming stereotypes about female sexuality there are women who do not want to consume pornography but at the same time there is a potential female audience for porn and i would say it is bigger than it has been assumed so far and it is increasing as our society overcomes gendered stereotypes in general keeping all this in mind i asked arrowsmith how she feels about the controversy about her work she said i have received very good responses from the press the readers and the general public now i want to join together my political work and the work i do in the porn industry im going to start campaigning for sex workers rights and encouraging women to fight for what they deserve,2011-03,anna arrowsmith aka

imagine if our jobs were determined by our ability to manage at home if the loss of a piece of sports kit failure to remember a playdate or to adequately clean our house resulted in our bosses telling us to go home and sort it out the outrage is almost funny no yet egyptian campaigner dalia ziada says that this is actually being considered in the new world order of the postrevolutionary egypt her comments caused a ripple of laughter at the opening session of the women in the world summit organised by tina brown in new york last night but ziada said with something like understatement its sort of funny but its terrible too indeed it may be marvellous that female campaigners and politicians are being given a voice in egypt after years without one but the sorts of laws being considered also show the lack of understanding between the experience of western women and those fighting for their rights in the middle east women from saudi arabia iraq and iran as well as egypt all said one thing could help not only narrow that gap but also their own ability to act the internet a space for unveiling the minds of muslim women the web is a place where no one cares if im a man or a woman says ziada they only care for my mind the web can also give us a greater understanding of a world in which saudi women arent allowed to drive and iraqi women use the colour and style of their headcovering to state their political allegiance it may also help clear up the sort of misunderstandings that lead to another astonishing statistic provided by melinda gates of the uberrich foundation bn endowment when asked how much money the us provides in foreign aid americans in a poll two years ago said the truth is less than a lower percentage than most of europe particularly the uk and norway she said announcing n to be spent on maternal and neonatal health in the developing world gates said when you go to the developing world you say to yourself i could have been born in this circumstance theres no reason i was born in the united states and not one of these other places in the world the atmosphere of the hudson theatre is celebratory today as hundreds of women hear from hillary clinton

last year started slow and snowy the office was deserted for the holiday season and i sat alone at my desk wondering how to carry out my new years resolution to crush the patriarchy this resolution was of course immodest impractical and unrealistic but it had one distinct advantage sheer ambition i started dipping into the guardians archive for inspiration and one idea one way i could do something concrete and lasting suddenly struck me the paper has been at the forefront of feminist coverage since the first womens liberation conferences and marches in the uk years ago and i realised that if i scrolled through the archives i could find material that opened a window into every major feminist issue of that period i could also find articles by or interviews with every major feminist icon i could put together a book that would be informative and hopefully encouraging for both ardent feminists and readers who had never encountered the movement before as i sifted through the material that would become guardian anthology women of the revolution forty years of feminism there came one testament after another to how womens lives have changed for the better in the uk and beyond as a result of feminist campaigning in a piece by eva figes from the s for instance she noted that back then uk women only earned p for every a man earned at the end of the office for national statistics reported that the pay gap between men and women taking into account both parttime and fulltime employees now stands at with men earning an average of an hour and women earning an average of an hour in that matter then there has been considerable progress but feminism remains a revolution halfmade why not simply equal pay for equal work and in some areas progress seems either to have stalled or gone backwards over the past decade internet pornography has proliferated lapdancing clubs have set up across the country and it has become a shrugging inevitability that many stag weekends will involve sex tourism in in england and wales only of rape cases reported to the police ended with a conviction on that charge the conviction rate is even lower in scotland this statistic has remained largely static for a decade and in terms of womens rights in the uk it is this that i would most like to see improve at the moment we have a culture in which thousands of women are raped each year yet only a tiny proportion are granted justice it is thought that only around of all rapes are reported to police in the first place which makes that conviction rate look even more paltry and problematic to fail women in this way is to suggest violent crimes against us dont matter will not be punished and that we must put up and shut up even in the face of the most harrowing abuse forty years after the start of womens liberation years after the first international womens day is this really how we want to live thankfully feminism is burgeoning in the uk and worldwide as the hundreds of events held for international womens day this week have proved here five brilliant feminists all of whom feature in women of the revolution write about the worldchanging shifts we have seen in the last few decades and the change they would most like to see come next suzanne moore today we must take nothing for granted the environment of recession provides the perfect preconditions for much hacking back at any equality we may have achieved and the key reforms over control of our own bodies the abortion act are still prey to fundamentalists of all faiths who want to control female sexuality we already had the pill but for me what has been vital in changing much for women has been technology we had the washing machine now we have the internet my daughter told me of a web page about domestic violence that does not show up in your online history allowing victims to switch easily to another page if their abuser comes into the room and without fear of being found out young women are no longer afraid of technology sure it may be a byproduct of capitalism that little girls are now part of the games market but at least it means that they are as adept at technology as the boys and can use it to their advantage we now connect and campaign internationally too would we have known so much about the treatment of sakineh mohammadi ashtiani the iranian woman sentenced to be stoned to death were it not for the online campaigning yes we remain divided into the information rich and the information poor and it is true that pornography thrives on the web but the internet can also be transformative many early feminists understood the liberating power of technology they thought it could mean we could do away with men i am not saying that exactly but the combination of feminist theory with these tools is new and exciting as for the future i am with valerie solanas who would have surely been a brilliant blogger the job of women remains to create a magic world suzanne moore is a journalist and commentator natasha walter over the past few years ive been working alongside women who have come to this country seeking sanctuary there have been some amazing milestones in their struggle but there is still so much to be done before women who come here fleeing persecution can find justice historically a refugee has been seen as an individual persecuted by the state specifically for their ethnicity or their political beliefs it was in that one great milestone was reached when the highest court in this country clearly recognised that women often flee another kind of persecution persecution based on their gender in the case known as shah and islam two women fleeing domestic violence in pakistan were recognised as refugees who were entitled to protection in the uk one judge stated that while domestic violence is experienced by women in the uk it would not create refugees out of british women because the victims of violence would be entitled to the protection of the state whereas in pakistan the state was unwilling or unable to offer her any protection this clear statement that in the absence of protection from their own states women are entitled to cross borders to find safety from genderrelated persecution even if that persecution took place in their families was a real milestone for women but this has remained for too many women a victory in theory only in practice many women who flee persecution related to their sex whether at the hands of their families or by police or soldiers are denied asylum in the west and fail to find safety many of them are even locked up during the process or after refusal right now i think a great next step for women refugees in the uk would be to see the notorious yarls wood detention centre closed the government has accepted that it should not be locking children up for seeking asylum time to show that women who come here fleeing persecution fleeing torture fleeing sexual abuse should not be imprisoned natasha walter is author of living dolls and a founder of women for refugee women jessica valenti feminists have so much to be proud of weve changed laws and policies hearts and minds in particular weve put a tremendous dent in violence against women and the way that it is handled worldwide in the united states the sexual histories of victims can no longer be used against them in court and the violence against women act has allocated billions of dollars to provide services to victims in the uk it is against the law to name rape victims and the definition of consent protects those who are unconscious or have lost the capacity to agree to sex but the work is far from done violence against women sexualised violence in particular is still at epidemic proportions the national crime victims research and treatment center reports that more than one million american women were raped in the uks home office reports that of women will experience a sexual assault and rape is still routinely used as a weapon of war across the globe young women women of colour immigrant women transmen and women and women with disabilities are all at a disproportionate risk and while we have made progress legal victories and policy changes are not the same thing as a cultural shift without altering the paradigm for how we think about sex gender violence and misogyny there will be no lasting change for women thankfully young feminists are taking up the cause they are blogging raising awareness and holding vigils in their communities and despite the popular notion of young women as politically apathetic they are taking direct action thousands of women protest about violence against women every year as part of million women rise and recently students at dickinson college in pennsylvania staged a threeday sit in demanding the college make its sexual assault policies more transparent after a number of rapes on campus were handled poorly by the administration women are taking action every day but until we are free from sexual violence no matter our gender race class or sexual history feminisms work will not be done until rape and sexual assault are rare anomalies instead of the terrifying norm that women are expected to live under we will not be free jessica valenti is a blogger author and founder of feministingcom nawal el saadawi women in most countries have not achieved much because they cant be liberated under the patriarchal capitalist imperialist and military system that determines the way we live now and which is governed by power not justice by false democracy not real freedom war criminals in the us and israel are not punished no international court has the courage to put them on trial we need to establish a new un and a new international criminal court we need real secularism to liberate women and a secular family code we women in egypt participated in the great revolution on january but after that we were not included in the new committee to change the constitution nor in the temporary government we started to organise and unite under the new egyptian women union which was banned several times by the regime of president hosni mubarak and his wife unity is power without unity women cannot fight for their rights anywhere nawal el saadawi is an egyptian psychiatrist writer and activist bidisha at this time in womens history i feel proud and sad not angry proud because despite what is done to us we show an almost supernatural strength i do not care if women call themselves feminists or not i care beyond language about womens selfdetermination freedom unity justice and joy there has always been a global womens movement and it has many names and many faces but i feel sad that whenever we speak about what is done to us we are told that we are liars trying to get innocent men into trouble out of malice it is rapists harassers exploiters bullies discriminators stalkers leerers and jeerers plus the millions of silent men who do nothing to challenge their brothers who act from malice i wish they did not excuse defend even reward the perpetrators i wish women had not absorbed all this loathing and turned it towards themselves and other women we have achieved some things in some places but our position is still tenuous and can be revoked the fundamentals have not changed close to home and far from home i am tired of how much we are despised and horrified by how transparent this is freedom justice and equal representation are withheld from us with laughable excuses i wish after thousands of years of abuse and exploitation cultural contempt and casual dismissal marginalisation and belittlement for things to change i wish people believed what we say about the things we experience and witness we are telling the truth there is now an understanding that rape domestic violence harassment sexual exploitation and labour exploitation happen endemically not only in times and places of macho warmongering but also in peacetime and seemingly happy societies these issues are brought to the debating table when the men in power chat among themselves about what is best but they have not actually ceased happening there is one thing that could halt the oppression of women virtually overnight there is one thing that could save us from exploitation from fear from anger from violation objectification baiting mockery the perpetrators could stop bidisha is a writer and commentator kira cochrane discusses women of the revolution at theguardiancombooks it is published by guardian books price to order

why are fewer and fewer americans deciding to get married is it because women prefer a working career and are less willing to get married if it means settling for less many feminists might applaud that reasoning but according to television writer tracy mcmillan its killing a womans chances of finding real love if they really want to get married and most women secretly or notsosecretly do she says then theyd better shape up whats the problem in a nutshell says mcmillan its womens unrealistic expectations about men but even more so their unrealistic expectations about themselves and what marriage has to offer youll just be you but with twice as much laundry she deadpans in this era of reexamined ideologies feminism among them mcmillans proposition may seem relatively uncontroversial not one to set the blogosphere atwitter but her huffington post articles gone virat and the debates still growing part of the reason is the vitriol that mcmillan whos been married three times and largely unhappily she confesses has heaped upon women while to many absolving men of blame to some feminists that makes mcmillan a sellout and more than a few female commentators have called her out consider how mcmillan states her case she uses the second person as if shes deliberately trying to get in the face and under the skin of her sisters mcmillan tells women that there are six main reasons you arent married starting with youre a bitch and youre shallow and ending with youre not good enough each sounds on its face like the kind of insulting epithet that women say that men or at least some men often hurl at them youre a slut a real sexist chestnut ranks at number three in mcmillans list but mcmillan it turns out is only riffing or so she says mainly shes tired of hearing women blame men while refusing to take a look at themselves under youre a bitch for example she says the real problem is that too many women sound and act angry and that terrifies men who really just want someone to be nice to them and she tries to be consoling i know it seems unfair that you have to work around a mans fear and insecurity in order to get married but actually its perfect since working around a mans fear and insecurity is big part of what youll be doing as a wife but mcmillan isnt just advocating a downtoearth acceptance of men foibles and all she really does believe that women are failing in relationships by not facing hard facts so she chastises women for acting as though they dont want to get married thereby thinking they wont scare a man off in the process but then using sex on the assumption that their partner will end up concluding he cant live without them i have news she says he will never figure this out he already knows he can live without you just fine and so do you or you wouldnt be lying to him in the first place my favourite reason is mcmillans last youre not good enough here she suggests that wanting a partner whos the tallest smartest and handsomest prince is a reflection of a womans own lack of selfworth women she says arent looking for partners who are their equal they want partners who are better as if by osmosis or sheer association it will eliminate their own perceived shortcomings the solution of course is selfacceptance mcmillan says but it also means accepting that marriage is about accepting someone and something other than yourself mcmillans article contrasts sharply with other highlydebated pieces that have appeared in magazines such as salon and the atlantic in recent years sandra tsing loh in a piece published two years ago announced that she was divorcing her husband whom she considered a good mate because the marriage was too much work and wasnt worth the sacrifices staying together just for the kids wasnt a good enough reason she said she even urged other women to divorce so as not to prop up an institution that was no longer economically necessary its not clear if mcmillan whos written scripts for shows like mad men and the united states of tara may be prefiguring a return to a somewhat older and more conventional view of marriage among many women at a time when selfproclaimed feminist conservatives like sarah palin and nikki haley are becoming ascendant in national politics challenging the views of the traditional womens movement mcmillan concludes marriage is just a longterm opportunity to practise loving someone even when they dont deserve it but as you give him love anyway because you have made up your mind to transform yourself into a person who is practising being kind deep virtuous truthful giving and most of all accepting of your own dear self you will find that you will experience the very thing you wanted all along love hardly the most popular theme among women addicted to sex and the city still hoping for something more than mcmillans messy farting macaroni and cheeseeating man for a lover and spouse,2011-03,fewer fewer american deciding get

its finally time to ring the death knell for traditional marriage last week the obama administration released a comprehensive report on the status of american women the first of its kind since the results are mixed they have made substantial gains in education but still make cents to a mans dollar are more likely than men to live in poverty and are more likely to be stalked or killed by intimate partners the report also sheds light on the status of the american family a social unit that has been remade by social liberalism conservatives are right traditional marriage is under attack but the assault isnt just from gay men and lesbians who want the right to enter into marriages of their own heterosexual janes and johns are also reshaping holy matrimony theyre marrying later theyre marrying less and for reasons other than having children and its making them and their kids happier and healthier the average age of marriage for a collegeeducated woman today is for a collegeeducated man women without a highschool diploma typically marry at back in the average marriage age was now thats right about the time that more women than ever are awarded their undergraduate degrees marriage for the middle class in america was then a fairly simple financial arrangement husband worked to support the family wife cared for the children and the home it wouldnt be the worst system if all human beings were worker bees without individual interests and passions but because some women are interested in the world beyond cooking dinners and changing diapers and some men dont want to spend their whole lives in offices or factories and instead want to get to know their kids marriage evolved conservatives of course want to ride this thing until the wheels fall off never mind that the sstyle traditional family that they so wholly exhort isnt actually all that traditional in the long history of marriage where women were given away as property from fathers to husbands back then women in many states couldnt open their own bank accounts until recently there were no laws against marital rape and domestic violence was viewed as a private matter and not one for legal intervention people who fell outside of rigid gender roles or were poor nonwhite or disabled didnt live in leave it to beaver fantasyland women who had children outside of marriage were whisked away to private homes where their babies were taken from them and put up for adoption children with disabilities were institutionalised nonwhite citizens were routinely barred from political participation and discriminated against with impunity significantly more children and elderly people lived in poverty than today and physical and sexual abuse of children was rarely investigated thanks to increased gender equality hastened in no small part by the advent of the birth control pill and the legalisation of abortion families are better off across the board mothers today spend more time with their children than they did in the height of the femalehomemaker family fathers also spend more time and more quality time with their children than ever before working outside the home has mental health benefits women who work have a higher sense of social competence and lower rates of depression than women who dont and with solebreadwinner obligations increasingly loosened men are freer to take on nontraditional roles as caring dads and attentive husbands who provide much more for their families than just a pay cheque and the more egalitarian the relationship the better couples who share both paid work and housework have more sex children of women with college degrees do better in school women who are collegeeducated tend to marry later and also have lower divorce rates they are more likely to stay married than women who arent highly educated and financially independent quite possibly because women who are selfsufficient dont need to get married for support and can choose a partner with whom they can have a happy and egalitarian relationship notably fewer men and women marry today than they did a few decades ago about of women and of men have never married in those figures were and respectively more women are also forgoing childbearing nearly twice as many women have never given birth today than in and when we do have children were doing it later the average age of childbirth is now compared with in the teen birthrate is also down significantly in the teen birthrate was per births today its those numbers are no indication that marriage and childrearing are pass or undervalued quite the opposite marriage more than ever is something that more people feel the right to opt out of which means that those of us who do marry except those who are shamefully barred from marriage because of their sexual orientation are opting in and doing so increasingly because we want to not because of social obligations if you believe that marriage can be a good thing for people who choose it this should be welcome news children too should be welcome additions and not obligations the fact that more women and families are delaying childbirth indicates that theres more planning involved and that women and men are making commitments to familial stability and personal ability before deciding to have kids were still a long way from a genderegalitarian marital utopia but traditional marriage is blessedly deceased with its demise has come a new marriage model that is by nearly every measure better for men women and children and is hopefully continuing to improve marriage itself is

all my life ive taken for granted that each generation of women would have more opportunities and greater equality than the last now i fear that in britain that is under threat the scale of the governments assault on womens lives is shocking but this is not just an accidental consequence of overrapid deficit reduction for both tories and liberal democrats it reflects a deeper ideological view about the role of the state the role of the family and as a consequence the role of women too we have to challenge the underlying philosophy if we are to restore progress recently i talked to hetty bower who is when she was she did not even have the right to vote when hetty had her daughter there was no nhs no maternity leave and no child benefit it wasnt until she was in her s that a labour woman cabinet minister legislated for equal pay thanks to the dagenham women and she had already received her telegram from the queen by the time a labour government doubled childcare provision increased support for working mothers and finally ended the year discrimination against women in the state pension but that progress has been hardwon only because generations of women argued and voted for change we need to campaign again to prevent progress stalling now against a greater assault from a government than we have seen at any time in the history of the welfare state george osbornes tax and benefit changes are hitting women hardest independent research shows men on average lose a week but women on average lose a week despite the fact that women still earn less and own less than men cuts to child tax credit childcare tax credit public sector pensions child benefit housing benefit and attendance allowance all hit women harder but they benefit less than men from the increase in the tax allowance and it isnt just about money in womens pocket womens jobs are being more heavily hit by cuts action on violence against women is being watered down services women rely on are under threat and the changes to the pension age are hitting women in their s particularly hard some suggest this is just the collateral damage of deficit reduction but i think there is evidence of a deeper ideological problem in both the tory and liberal democrat views david cameron nick clegg and george osborne all take the view that state action including financial support for the family promotes dependency and should be rolled back indeed cleggs central argument for cutting tax credits was we need to get out of the habit of making families ever more dependent on the state the trouble is as millions of women know tax credits and public services are often what gives them independence for some mothers cuts in childcare support mean they can no longer afford to go out to work for others who have decided to stay at home while their children are small lower tax credits may mean they have to go back to work after all if you cut support for families you dont increase womens independence you reduce it because you cut the choices women are able to make so it is the philosophy not just the policies that we need to challenge not just for women but for everyone because while women still tend to face greater family pressures increasing numbers of men have caring responsibilities too and everyone is harmed by an ideology that attacks public sector intervention for undermining independence when in practice it is vital for many people to achieve the independence and opportunities they seek otherwise for the first time we risk seeing the clock turned back i know i have had more opportunities in life than my mother and grandmother before me but now for the first time i worry about my daughters hetty bower just rejoined the labour party because she is worried about the governments plans generations of women need to rally together now not only to protect what we have fought for but to restore progress for our daughters and granddaughters too,2011-03,life ive taken

eve mcdougall has come a long way since when at years old she was serving a twoyear sentence in an adult prison for breaking a window i was hungry i saw bread in a bakery so i broke in i cant tell you the mental damage it did being in an adult jail i was terrified when i think how things have turned out i cant believe it now mcdougall who describes herself as a selftaught artist is to show her artwork in an exhibition in london from march mcdougalls work will be on display along with that of other women exprisoners and prisoners in a gallery run by the mental health charity together ive been drawing and painting since i was a kid she explains ive always found it so therapeutic the free exhibition girls behind bars female experiences of justice which mcdougall helped organise will include works ranging from video installation to sculpture to painting as well as short stories and poetry mcdougall believes it will offer an insight into the often harsh experiences of women prisoners the hope is that it will give members of the public and people who work in the justice system a different perspective of women who have been in jail its about opening minds claire monger who comanages the gallery for together says the idea for the exhibition came to her after meeting mcdougall she was so impressed she asked her to be a consultant on the project working with experienced curators ronee hui and louise mcdonnell through the art and words of female prisoners offenders and exoffenders the exhibition aims to explore their life experiences and what justice has been like from their points of view monger explains we hope it will raise further awareness of the problems that can be caused by sending vulnerable women to prison and the benefits of alternatives timed to coincide with the fourth anniversary of the corston report a landmark inquiry headed by baroness corston following the deaths of six women at styal prison which looked at the experiences of vulnerable women within the criminal justice system the organisers hope the project will shed renewed light on the issue women account for just of the prison population but campaigners are concerned borne out by corstons original report that most are incarcerated for nonviolent offences while around have two or more mental health conditions women also account for more than half of all selfharm among the prison population advocates are also worried that pressure on funding could threaten many of the support initiatives established after corston was published i really hope we can have an impact

britain may still have appalling representation of women in parliament as of the general election there were female mps to more than male mps but the streets tell a different story in the four major education protests before christmas women were frequently at the forefront organising talking to the media standing up against increasingly aggressive police tactics and articulating how and why the cuts would affect students in the european student protests of may the student leaders we remember were male rudi dutschke daniel cohnbendit in many of the people responsible for heading meetings and coordinating occupations are women the rise of women to senior positions in major trade unions too long bastions of male dominance must also be seen as a major victory for progressive politics of course it would be a mistake to think that protest comes about because of the leadership of a few charismatic figures which is why the participation of all taking part in occupations and protests should be celebrated without imagining that these things simply emerge from nowhere or as a recent argument has it because social networking has suddenly allowed protest to be organised at lightning speed in the buildup to what looks likely to be the biggest trade union demonstration in recent history on march the role of women in organising and participating in protest will continue to be central nevertheless for the usual suspects the participation of so many young women in the education protests in particular has given rise to a certain moral panic see for example the hilarious daily mail cover rage of the girl rioters the attempted pillorying of these young women accused of lacking respect by the mail is the latest in a long line of attacks on women who campaign directly against the state the suffragettes women involved in the general strike the miners protests in the mids those who fought for reproductive rights and against domestic violence just as with the attack on ladettes in the s what looks to be a moral criticism frequently masks a deeper political and economic fear what shall we do when young women are academically successful economically independent socially confident and not afraid to enjoy themselves could there be anything more terrifying it would be a mistake to imagine that the strong participation of women in recent political protests is something new nevertheless the flip side of this female visibility is the way in which women particularly workingclass women are already far more likely to be negatively affected by the cuts combined with the disparity in pay between men and women and the fact that it is women who still do most domestic work and childcare even if they are doing two or three other jobs outside the home it seems obvious why more women would be taking to the streets the past few years have similarly seen an eruption of interest in feminism across the country with meetings and book launches spilling over with women and men of all ages whatever the s tried to tell us was over from inequality to political commitment has most definitely not gone away and the idea that one would simply have a passive ironic or otherwise disinterested stance towards the brutal and brutalising policies of a government hellbent on removing any vestige of a social bond now looks historically outmoded while there were many women tirelessly campaigning throughout the s and s on a variety of issues both those that directly concerned women and as part of broader political campaigns it was with the antiwar marches from onwards that the kind of street politics we see today came back on the agenda in a more visible way many of the schoolkids who played truant to attend antiwar protests have grown into articulate and politically passionate adults rightly incensed that education is being transformed into something insanely expensive increasingly exclusive and socially divisive the explosive mix of singleissue campaigns such as uk uncut broader anticuts struggles and a growing worldwide recognition that the corruption and complicity of governments are no longer tolerable means that everywhere men and women are realising that what unites them is far greater than what divides them when young women feel they are no longer held back by their gender that they can take on any job that they are more likely to do well in education than their male peers that they dont have to think of themselves as wives and mothers first one outcome is an increase in political confidence if you tell women they can be and can do anything they want and then let them down by taking away their education maintenance allowance by making university prohibitively expensive by forcing them to stay in poverty they along with their male peers will make you pay for your lies and hypocrisies while the mail presumably thought that girl rioters would terrify its middle england readership this should only serve to encourage us to recognise that female emancipation and political emancipation more generally will start with those most angry about its incompletion,2011-03,britain may still appalling representation woman

a century ago international womens day was associated with peace and womens and girls sweated labour which votes for women were to deal with not a celebration but a mobilisation and because it was born among factory workers it had class real class later it came to celebrate womens autonomy but changed its class base and lost its edge this centenary must mark a new beginning we live in revolutionary times we dont need to be in north africa or the middle east to be infected by the hope of change enough to witness on tv the woman who veiled in black from head to foot led chants in cairos tahrir square routing sexism and islamophobia in one unexpected blow she and the millions moving together have shaken us from our provincialism and shown us how rapidly things can change women in egypt have called for a million women to occupy tahrir square today who would have predicted that a month ago feminism has tended to narrow its concerns to what is unquestionably about women abortion childcare rape prostitution pay equity but that can separate us from a wider and deeper womens movement in bahrain for example women lead the struggle for jobs housing clean water peace and justice as well as every demand we share the revolution is spreading scott walker the tea partys state governor in wisconsin aims to destroy state workers collective bargaining rights as in britain most employees and service users attacked by the cuts are women a male colleague told demonstrators who had occupied the state capitol the administration made a calculation that the men would not support the women now they know otherwise he ended his speech with the phrase on everyones lips fight like an egyptian now we know the tea party is after women what will womens organisations do about it the only one anywhere near is a longtime fighting network of welfare mothers wisconsin in the s led on welfare reform the blueprint for uk cuts welfare mothers remember that few stood with them then it has not always been easy to pull up womens neglected interests from beneath the general cause the best way is to ask the women who often shout unheard the single mothers the teachers the nurses the sex workers the care workers the asylum seekers the pensioners but as feminists our hearing and our focus are corrupted when we concentrate on getting women into the corridors of power recently the uk government warned big companies that they must double the number of women in boardrooms while it increases the poverty of women and of children will we allow that or can we turn this around and demand the money from corporations and banks for women children and all who need it such a turnaround presumes a return of feminism to class not the restricted concepts of the s but a new definition that begins with women internationally from bahrain to palestine from haiti to pakistan where women fight for survival and justice after earthquakes floods coups and occupations how do we deal with the fact that our biology is an encumbrance for alan sugar who wants to question women job applicants about their parental intentions its even an embarrassment for some paid to represent us when a trade union equality worker was asked to endorse our iwd event she wrote back is it just me or is the mothers march banner disturbing many feminists have become convinced that we can only escape romanticised visions of maternal slavery by denying we are mothers at all to be a financially independent individual as well as or instead of a mother we have traded away the social power that comes from recognition of the contribution of motherhood the making of the human race the creation of the labour force marching as mothers we transform the attitude to that work from a social liability to the social contribution that it is in this way we help put all women in a stronger position to demand wages and working conditions that take account of the caring work most of us are already doing whether were mothers or not new boldness allows us to face what marx and engels called our real conditions of life and our relations with our kind women refusing to be trapped at home and demanding that men not be trapped out of home takes us immediately beyond the market which only considers work that leads to profit for others not to equity nor to happiness nor even to survival to undermine once and for all the sexual division of labour we women and men must aim to work less we can then begin where we all began with children what do they need first of all adults not just parents who love them and work to make a relationship with them that is after all what caring is we need time for this prime time we cannot be punished for our involvement in this civilising life process nor can we allow men to be excluded from it so this international womens day we must at least consider claiming the money from banks and wars to pay for the society of carers that only we together can devise taking the lead of the women in tahrir square we can change the world selma james is organiser of the global womens strike mothers march,2011-03,century ago international womens

this is international womens day and it is a great moment to take the temperature of the womens movement in the uk for quite a while its been clear that the longpredicted demise of feminism has not happened on the contrary over the last few years there have been sparks of new life that have surprised many observers you can map those sparks in the growth of grassroots events such as the million women rise march launched three years ago and the feminism in london conference whose thousand cheering delegates surprised me with their numbers and energy last year you can also map them in the increasing readiness of influential organisations and individuals from the un to judi dench to be associated with what might once have been seen as stridently feminist rhetoric to see the grassroots and the establishment coming together is to witness a movement with a great legacy taking on new energy international womens day has not historically been a huge deal in the uk it kicked off in in more idealistic and embattled times when women all over the western world were seeking basic political and employment rights with its roots in the international socialist movement it is perhaps unsurprising that we hear it has more of a profile in china and russia than in britain but it has shifted up a gear this year to mark the centenary and has been boosted in the uk by the new equals coalition which has brought together a raft of charities arts organisations and individuals to join the celebrations and protests when i first clicked on equals promotional film i laughed out loud to see daniel craig being questioned by judi dench on gender equality its hugely pleasurable for those of us who have been banging on about equal rights for years to see these arguments being taken on in a minibond film directed by sam taylorwood the arguments have jumped out of the ghetto theyre in the mainstream now as i wrote in the new feminism in id prefer to see feminism not as a separate movement but as part of the very air we breathe we should all women and men young and old be concerned about the ways in which women across the world are still prevented from realising their dreams simply because they are women but we still have to be careful that as feminism broadens its appeal it does not lose its force its bite its ability to create real change international womens day began in a solid socialist movement and as it moves more towards the middle ground that obviously changes its temper but i am heartened by the strength of the demands being made on all sides although my first reaction to the equals film was a laugh when i listened to it i felt grim again the facts that dench tells us are not new to many of us but it still hurts to hear again that millions of girls worldwide are deprived of a basic education or that two women a week in the uk are killed by a current or former partner these realities remind us that for all its achievements feminism has produced an unfinished revolution too often it is implied that feminism is some kind of western construct that we should be wary of exporting to the rest of the world this argument is simply ignorant of the work that women have done and are doing throughout africa asia and south america to fight for their rights in the charity i founded women for refugee women i work alongside women from many different countries and cultures who have come to the uk for sanctuary from persecution none of them would have any truck with the idea that human rights are less important to them because mary wollstonecraft didnt write in their language so its good to hear annie lennox who is taking a leading role in international womens day activities this year point out that from india to illinois women face violence just for being female or to realise that if you join one of women for women internationals bridge events today you will be at just one of hundreds of events worldwide from afghanistan to the democratic republic of the congo if today shows something of the strength of those who seek genuine equality as well as the scale and importance of what remains to be achieved then it will be a day

who still did not understand the problem the action plan will outline the governments next steps after publication of a strategy document in november calling for an end to violence against women it is expected to recommend developing police training programmes on sexual and domestic violence including socalled honourbased violence and continuing specialist training for prosecutors in violence against women the government will also announce funding of to help develop four centres supporting victims of rape and sexual violence these will be run by rape crisis in trafford hereford and exeter and by the survivors trust in bournemouth last years document said recent immigrants should be better informed about their right not to face honour violence for behaviour deemed to have shamed their family or community and where they could get support but ikwro said a wider number of professionals needed better training including teachers and social workers every single day girls and women in the uk are locked up threatened beaten forced into marriage and even murdered by their families in the name of so called honour diana nammi from the group said while promising to increase training for police and prosecutors the new action plan does not do enough to protect these vulnerable women and girls the government is talking about rolling out training promised three years ago but what it really needs is a national strategy to get to grips with this problem in police recorded over incidents of honourbased violence in london alone ikwro which took calls on its advice line last year said it suspected there were thousands more cases across the country a home office spokesman said honour based violence is unacceptable and has no place in our society we are determined to tackle it and all other forms of violence against women and girls the government will continue to raise awareness of honour based violence and work hard to ensure that victims are aware of their rights and the

annie lennox our challenge has to be how do you create change we have inherited a tremendous amount from our foresisters to have the right to equality to education and access to reproductive healthcare unfortunately our consumeristic celebrityfixated culture has glossed over all those things so that we who are so resourced dont use our resources as we should in britain we take what we have for granted yet if you go to developingworld countries the disparity between men and women is enormous and values and practices can go back to medieval times beverley knight singer its interesting that in the countries where women have the least power the least equality international womens day is much more treasured here in britain with our excess of everything the very things that are so precious that the emmeline pankhursts gave their spirit and their lives to we take for granted we dont think about the struggle that other women have across the world vv brown singer and model im worried for young women how everything is about how can i be famous how can i make money quickly we need to make sure that our role models are not just reality tv contestants but doctors judges intellectuals al there is this misconception that fame and celebrity is something to be had as a goal in itself and im outraged by the wastefulness of the movement of feminism when were just sitting on the couches watching reality tv while our daughters are being brainwashed jane shepherdson whistles chief executive the majority of women in this country work in the caring professions such as nursing teaching etc and theyre some of the worstpaid jobs and a lot of those people will lose their jobs because of the coalitions cuts capitalism values making money above everything else one would imagine that nurturing the next generation would be something wed value highly and thats something women do whether its because were predisposed to it or not women do do this bk i looked to my mum for everything down to the fact that she wore glasses so i wanted to wear glasses as i got older it was her strength of character i wanted to emulate what would make someone of years of age get on a plane from montego bay to britain and be determined to make a new life for children she hadnt even had yet her strength ambition the grace that was needed to deal with people who were hostile to her being in the country i look at her and i still think wow js my mother was a biochemist my father a mathematician and there was no question that one partner in the marriage wasnt as equal as the other i came home from school and my mother was at work and if people said it was a shame i had to come home and there was no one there i thought why of course my mother should work i think that has had a huge bearing on my life katharine whitehorn journalist and it isnt just that you say i want to be like her my role models were actually men it never occurred to my father to give me a worse education than my brothers which was a rarity in those days and george seddon who i worked with when he was womens editor of the observer changed things completely by making newspapers carry pieces that women were interested in monica ali author there was a woman prime minister when i was at secondary school the sex discrimination act had been passed already and when i went to college womens rights was still a politicised issue given all that why have we still such a long way to go in terms of pay boardroom inequality lack of women mps figures of domestic violence percentage of housework and childcare done by women part of the answer is the tendency to blame biology theres a tendency to shrug and say women have children so theres a career gap instead of thinking well in what ways can we make sure that doesnt disadvantage women js we kind of go oh great theres two women in the cabinet thats shocking we are half the population were not a minority and were not represented in the way we should be ma feminism has fallen off the agenda years ago at college it was in our discourse kw you forget how recent some of the victories are were taught in school that we have a right to be tried by a jury of our peers and no woman had that until as there were no women on juries before that ma i have a daughter whos and we walked past a billboard the other day advertising a tv programme there was a row of men in suits and a woman in a thong my daughter said why is it like that its to sell it isnt it she knows that already i said yes its a shame a young woman would want to be portrayed in that way and she said but its her choice isnt it nobody made her do that so how do you explain the gramscian concept of hegemony to a year old if the culture is so all pervasive that you cant think outside of it how are you making genuine choices al this incredible consumeristic culture comes in waves in the playground you try and resist and the trouble is you end up feeling like you are the enemy its everywhere the advertising is ubiquitous ma and its dressed up in the language of empowerment of women proclaiming our sexuality and the freedom of the individual so if youre seen to be against that then theres something wrong with you bk annie vv and i come from a music industry where if you dare to stick your head above the parapet and say actually i dont really want to be defined as a musician in terms of the size of my breasts instantly marketing managers will put you in the box marked as trouble shes going to be difficult js oversensitive irrational all those labels ive come up through an industry with men who are quite bullying alphamale characters to succeed in any business women have to be unafraid of confrontation but a lot of women would rather avoid it and that tends to be a reason they dont succeed as they think you know what its not really worth the trouble ill just do this instead ma i felt great strides had been made in the literary world after all we all know women write but i saw this letter in ms magazine written to the new yorker it said i was already alarmed when i flipped through the december double issue that three out of the pages were penned by women again every critic is a man and out of the illustrators for that issue are men an analysis of literary journals by vidaweb which counts the number of authors reviews in shows the average is male contributions to female women authors are not getting taken as seriously as men it would be easy in the world i inhabit to say theres jk rowling hilary mantel look at the plaudits they get theres no problem is there al i never thought i was going to have to struggle with issues of equality its not people trying to put you down its more about mediocrity when theyre in an organisation people have a small vision and a blinkered idea about what it means to be an artist or successful and theyre looking for a cookiecutter success when i started wearing a mans suit i understood what i was saying but instead people questioned my sexual orientation the issue got reduced to one of whether i was gay and im not bk certainly in music the way people are perceived to be successful or doing well is how many units not even albums have you sold and how can we sell this product shes a woman fastest way to do it sex if she doesnt have the formulaic gardenvariety look were after shes going to be difficult and you get women who embrace that take that skewed image of what it is to be successful basing it on looks and regarding themselves as being empowered when the spice girls talked about girl power i thought what powers that then what are you talking about it started the whole marketingisgod downfall vvb perceptions need to be shifted back to there being substance in things and that comes back to education encouraging girls to do something that means something to them i want to be a lawyer because i want to help someone i want to be a musician because i love the art i want to be a better woman because it means something to me my mum runs a school where there are just as many female mathematicians as male ones as many women scientists as men why arent there any female producers music engineers al there are very many other women who would identify a different type of challenge we need to look at equality for all not only for example for the rise wed like to see in salaries to close the pay gap in the uk i had an opportunity to see the situation in south africa and it changed my perspective so radically once id understood that i am living in a bubble and the majority of women around the world do not have the access to things i have taken for granted kw and it isnt just the inequality of this country with the rest of the world its the inequality within this country we harp on about that fact that there arent enough women in boardrooms but for educated women in britain were in incredibly good shape compared to years ago and yet there are thousands of genital mutilations done in this country every year al in south africa its a tidal wave of hiv i was in the offices of the rolling stone magazine at christmas with lots of intelligent informed writers and i asked them to put their hand up if they knew that one in three people in that country were carrying the hiv virus no one put their hands up you have thousands of people dying millions of orphans and they dont know its incredible to me that wakeup call i had going into peoples houses where women were dying because they couldnt get access to lifesaving medication how do you galvanise this sense of injustice ma theres a perception that as countries develop economically issues of gender and inequality will automatically get better whereas the whole thing needs to be stood on its head so that gender inequality is at the very centre of it all a lot of studies show that if you focus on womens rights that in itself is an engine for development female literacy rates strongly correlate with fertility rates so if you educate women you will have fewer and healthier children if you invest in women the money they make will then be more likely to be invested in their families and local communities gender isnt something to be dragged along behind bk to illustrate your point when i went to salvador to see what certain charity groups were doing to combat hiv who was at the absolute heart of every single aspect of the fight women it was the women who were educating other women showing them pictures of different stis and saying this is what can happen if you dont insist your husbands protect themselves i went on a march through the streets with women protesting about murders that had happened people killed because they had hiv these women who were seemingly without a voice were getting together marching through the streets singing i came home a different person i thought how apathetic have i been my whole life these women are way more empowered than me al for me the anomaly is that the western countries are so resourced i can identify with a woman losing a child this happened to me i lost a baby but im living in a place where i can get medical treatment a woman in rwanda or uganda or bangladesh will deliver a baby on the floor and probably it wont survive and theres a good chance the mother wont either being conscious of this vast disparity between our experiences im appalled the word feminism has been denigrated to a place of almost ridicule and i very passionately believe the word needs to be revalued and reintroduced with power and understanding that this is a global picture it isnt about us and them ma are you saying that despite the huge advances here were in danger of forgetting or not relating to instances elsewhere al not in danger of we do were not even aware because its something you cant begin to imagine it doesnt happen in your street ma so we need to get feminism back on the agenda in this country and one of the results of doing so will be that we can relate back to the people and their struggle elsewhere al katharine mentioned genital mutilation what about the young girl who is taken as a child bride becomes pregnant delivers a baby everything is wrecked and she is incontinent and she is the victim she is the one displaced outside the village who no one will come near or the young girl in bangladesh who is raped and then lashed to death these are the injustices how can i hear this and not do something about it bk but when you speak up about it youre the one who is labelled as combative aggressive because feminism is seen as some kind of putting on of a mans angry cloak youre either laughed at or youre some woman with big bovver boots and a shaved head trying to be like a guy thats the response you get feminism is neither of those two things its about women caring about other women giving a voice to those who have no other voice join equals big inequality debate at weareequalsorg annie lennox and vv

former home secretary jacqui smith this week reopened the debate about the impact of the sex industry on society with her bbc radio documentary about pornography here gail dines professor of sociology and womens studies at wheelock college in boston and author of pornland how porn has hijacked our sexuality and anna arrowsmith a former liberal democrat candidate who makes pornographic films under the name anna span discuss the issues emine saner listens in gail dines im concerned about what it means to live in a society that is overwhelmed by images created by predatory capitalists whose job is to maximise profits pornography is the commodification of sexuality and the product is plasticised and lacks any individuality my feeling is that youre talking from a more personal perspective and there are certainly ways in which some women can make pornography work for them my issue is beyond you and me and into a more political analysis of what it means to live in a society where women are systematically discriminated against and then have a juggernaut called pornography shaping the way men think about us the same men who go on to make laws and policy that impact on the lives of women anna arrowsmith i used to be antipornography until i realised my anger was jealousy i was envious of men having their sexuality catered for i realised the best thing i could do was to work towards women learning their own sexual identity im not just coming from a personal experience ive been chair of the adult industry trade association in the uk we dont get well represented in the media were a soft target using moral panics to say were the devil and that if you just get rid of pornography amazingly women will get full equality gd i understand being envious of mens sexual freedom but the bigger point is that men have too much economic and cultural power and women making pornography is not going to change that if we want equality we will have to do it on the political and economic level and making porn is a trivial response aa the antiporn stance encourages women to think of themselves as victims gd how aa you dont allow women the individual choice to opt in gd of course individual women can be empowered im extremely empowered in my life but just because i as a white middleclass educated woman am empowered does not mean we have womens liberation it means i have a duty to use my privilege to fight for women who are discriminated against aa so do i and thats why i fight against people who argue against women in the sex industry we get a lot of aggression from people like you and its important that empowered women like myself stand up for porn stars and say please listen to them if they say they are happy please respect their autonomy gd women who work in the sex industry and promote this in the name of feminism are the scabs of the feminist movement i think you are an apologist and selling women out aa im not an apologist im here because women want sexuality to be represented if you hand over all sexual imagery to men you hand over that power im not saying all pornography is positive to women but the only way you are going to change that is from working with the images themselves gd we know that most women leave the porn industry with barely the clothes on their backs they do not leave with millions of dollars this industry is based on poor women who have few economic choices pornography is promoted as a way to economic empowerment and thats a lie aa i wouldnt disagree that women have bad experiences after leaving the porn industry but that is because society has such a bad attitude towards people who work in the sex industry thats the attitude of the mainstream media and the culture we live in who dont respect sex workers as equals gd i would put the stigma on the users and the men who buy sex i am for women thinking about images of sexuality but its a joke if you think you are going to do it within this predatory capitalist industry i went on your website and it looks like any other porno website what are you doing that is different from what every other pornographer is doing aa you havent seen my films an important part of them is the development of character and plot and the role women play in the film women have an opportunity now to express their sexuality anyone can get a webcam and go on the internet it has turned into a massive cottage industry and that is an incredibly democratic move gd anyone can get an allotment and grow their own food but the reality is that the food industry is run by agrobusiness and the porn industry is run by the mega porn businesses with all due respect you are not shaping male sexuality on a macro level aa you insult us alternative porn makers ive had a huge effect in the industry in how women are perceived in films and how men now direct in the uk ive also changed stylistically and creatively how porn films are made in the uk you will see a lot more camera angles looking at the man from a female point of view and that is because i worked within the industry and i changed it women need a voice against women like you to stand up and say im not a victim you need to talk to porn stars gd porn stars do you know how many porn stars there are the vast majority of women ive talked to in the industry are not porn stars they last three to five months and leave with very little money thats the way people coming from your position misrepresent the lives of women in the industry the vast majority do not become stars having more women in the industry is a copout aa i can tell you that from watching pornography i have learned more about my own sexuality it was my first instance of having an orgasm and a lot of women learn that through pornography gd this is not about you this is about a huge industry that is having an enormous cultural impact we have a right as a culture to define an authentic sexuality that grows out of peoples experiences desires sexual needs and wants what weve got instead is a generic formulaic sexuality that comes out of an industry thats what industries do to think that you can work in an industry and somehow change it thats a naive view

last month a teenage boy in iowa made headlines when he forfeited a high school wrestling match rather than face his opponent a girl named cassy herkelman joel northrup claimed that as a matter of conscience and faith he couldnt engage in physical contact with a female wrestler in iowa as in many us states girls and boys do wrestle each other and have for some years northrup immediately became a hero to american social conservatives who anointed him a young icon of traditional masculine chivalry but the larger symbolism of northrups act has gone unnoticed this wasnt about gallantry or a fear of sexualised contact with a girl though fear of losing to a young woman was surely a factor theres a bigger story here the longing of too many young men for allmale spaces in which they dont have to compete with women as equals northrups forfeit came the same week as the release of a new book manning up how the rise of women has turned men into boys penned by kay hymowitz a prominent american conservative manning up argues that womens achievements have emasculated men leaving teen and twentysomething lads with precious little reason to strive for anything more than a life of puerile amusement for hymowitz the feminist movements success in integrating into traditional male spheres has robbed men of a chance to feel important and valued as a consequence more and more would be choosing to opt out retreating to pot pornography and playing video games on their mothers couches though some have suggested that hymowitz oversells the problem of young mens irresponsibility the real problem with her thesis is her claims about its cause if more and more young men are drifting aimlessly through their s and s and turning adolescence into a quartercentury project the problem isnt women its the archaic but still potent rules of masculinity these guy rules or man laws define manliness as the absence of anything feminine the first rule is no sissy stuff what is masculine are only those things that women cant do like write their names in the snow while urinating or until recently fly fighter jets and wrestle boys even within their short lifetimes northrup and herkelman have seen women move into more and more positions that were once exclusively male for lads whose sense of masculinity is rooted in doing what women cannot do this means retreating to the few spaces where women are still not permitted to enter as soon as a girl like cassy does intrude suggesting that she has the right and ability to compete at a once allmale activity that activity instantly loses its masculine cachet and so millions of young men on both sides of the atlantic are doing what joel northrup did forfeiting the competition altogether contrary to what hymowitz argues male responsibility does not require female vulnerability to thrive the problem rather is a culturally constructed one men have been raised to believe that many of the things truly worth doing are those that women cannot do or more accurately were not allowed to partake in despite his claims about his faith joel northrup didnt forfeit his match because of anything in scripture forbidding boys and girls from wrestling there isnt he didnt forfeit because of chivalry he didnt even forfeit because of fear of losing to a girl he did so because the very presence of a female competitor robbed the

judges have for years struggled to define what makes one rape worse than another and for good reason the very definition of rape suggests an irreducible degree of trauma and the idea of ranking rapes by level of seriousness can come across as particularly abhorrent to victims that hasnt stopped the courts from trying in a guideline case in still cited today lord lane said that the usual starting point of a fiveyear sentence for rape would raise to eight years in some circumstances where a rape is committed by two or more perpetrators acting together where the perpetrator is in a position of responsibility towards the victim or where the victim is abducted and held captive for example and lane said a perpetrator who has broken into or otherwise gained access to a place where the victim is living should also fall into the eightyear category in these views were reflected in official sentencing guideline council rules and now the lord chief justice igor judge has gone further on this last category socalled safe haven rapes in a form of prosecution appeal where the solicitor or attorney general refer cases to the court of appeal arguing that the trial judges sentence is too lenient judge has almost doubled the sentences of three men michael anigbugu hyungwoo pyo and mark mcgee the three men were all convicted of breaking into and raping women in their own homes sexual offences committed by a burglar should be approached as if they are among the most serious offences of their kind judge said this might chime with the instinct of many women pyos offence for example represents many female students worst nightmare his yearold victim was a fellow undergraduate at loughborough university he broke into her room in halls of residence at am silencing her with a gloved hand and then duct tape as he gagged bound and raped her there is no questioning the seriousness of this type of attack or the fact that it warrants a serious sentence there is a problem however when this type of attack by an intruder is compared and contrasted with other forms of rape deemed less serious by the courts for example in m another wellknown rape case in then lord chief justice lord taylor sentenced a man who raped his wife in the bed they still shared after their marriage had broken down to just months there is a distinction between a husband who is estranged from his wife and returns to the house as an intruder and a case where as here the husband is still living in the same house and indeed with consent occupying the same bed as his wife taylor said that case at a time when the courts were still in the first years of getting to grips with the concept of rape within marriage would not be decided the same way now but in millberry a more recent case still cited in the courts then lord chief justice lord rose made it clear that stranger rape was still regarded as usually more serious than rape within a relationship when considering stranger rape the victims fear can be increased because her assailant is an unknown quantity rose said is he a murderer as well as a rapist in addition there is the fact that when a rape is committed by a stranger in a public place not only is the offence horrific to the victim it can also frighten other members of the public this element is less likely to be a factor that is particularly important in a case of marital rape were the parties to the marriage are living together now judge has added his new doctrine that rape in a safe haven is worse than rape in say a dark alley because the sanctity of the home has been violated it is possible to follow the logic in all of these cases but the best advice when it comes to dealing with rape sentences also comes from the court of appeal and from judge himself it is unwise to seek to compartmentalise the levels of culpability that can arise in sexual offences it is fundamental to the correct approach that the necessary flexibility to which reference is expressly made should be borne in mind the facts that gave rise to those remarks were particularly extreme two teenage girls were repeatedly gangraped by young men who filmed their ordeal and in one case finished the attack by permanently deforming the victim with a dose of caustic soda but the point is that no two rapes are the same and no categories of offence necessarily account for the brutality of the crime or its effect on the victim these are the factors which judges essentially seek to reflect in the sentence they pass but ranking the seriousness of rape according to where it took place assuming that a rape in a strange place is better than rape in the home and that rape in the home is better when it takes place in the marital bed is reminiscent of the courts past not its future,2011-03,judge year

when the norwegian parliament finally decided to make gender quotas mandatory for the boards of publicly listed companies in november it came as no big surprise after all norway has gender quotas everywhere from childrens councils in schools up to government ministers the surprise was that the person who championed the mandatory quotas was a male minister from our conservative party ansgar gabrielsen then minister of business told the newspaper verdens gang that he was fed up with the male dominance in the norwegian boardrooms gabrielsen caught his own party off guard and soon conservative mps whod habitually quote ayn rand and mock the nanny state found themselves forced to vote in favour of a law that gave norwegian companies about two years to get the percentage of women in the boards of directors up from to if they didnt reach that goal in time the state would make the quotas mandatory some supporters of the law hailed the blessings of more diversity in the boardrooms and equal opportunities for the sexes but gabrielsens main argument was that the boards cannot afford to use only half of the populations brain power that women actually had some brain power worth using he tried to show by referring to a survey showing that everything else being equal companies with more women in their boards were more profitable both the nho the main employers organisation and a couple of high profile male and female business leaders warned the politicians against the change claiming that mandatory quotas would depress the value of norwegian stocks and make women second rate members of the boards in general most of them agreed that more women on the boards were a good thing they just thought mandatory quotas were too drastic a measure like winnie the pooh bumping his head while being dragged down a flight of stairs and thinking there must be a more comfortable way of getting from a to b the critics of mandatory quotas thought there must be a more comfortable way to gender balance than threatening the companies that they would be dissolved by court the norwegian experience shows it isnt so the period of voluntary recruitment of women didnt change much but three years after the law was established gabrielsen had his was it worth it when it comes to diversity i am not so sure most of the female board members are lawyers economists and rich heiresses just like the men they replaced but at least a survey in showed that the female members of the boards had a bit more education than their male counterparts its also difficult to show that the females made the companies more profitable the aforementioned survey might just as well reflect that the companies that hired females voluntarily were more profitable because they were more openminded than the others or more likely they had a more professional way of recruiting their members not just picking their friends one survey which was conducted before the law was created showed that female members of the boards were usually recruited through professional networks while male members were more commonly recruited through private networks the story of the former norwegian prime minister gro harlem brundtland illustrates the same point she claimed her career began because of gender quota back in the mids the then prime minister hadnt made her a minister if it wasnt for the unofficial rule that the government had to contain at least one woman because of this bruntland went into fulltime politics first as a minister then prime minster then as leader of the un committee that came up with the notion of sustainable development she recently resigned as head of the world health organisation the same argument goes for boards the quotas force the companies to look around for women and find talent they wouldnt have found without it in nonpublic companies the number of women is still far below and there is no branch of industry where the rate of women is higher than the mandatory if not forced to by law companies dont recruit women in a norwegian newspaper discovered that a company owned in part by business minister gabrielsen had no women on the board at all as the company wasnt publicly listed this was all perfectly legal and yet a little odd for an owner that had spent the last year talking nonstop about the importance of using the brain power of the whole population like the prime minister in the s the business leaders of today have nothing against women it just so happens that they know so many nice and able men so why look any further when you are to fill up your board mandatory quotas are bureaucratic they hurt both the pride of women and the freedom of business but if you genuinely want more women in the boards its probably the only way to achieve it,2011-03,norwegian parliament finally decided make gender quota mandatory board publicly listed company november came big surprise norway ha gender quota everywhere childrens council school

its the little things its the sweetie to a female researcher or waitress the little pat the way women mps are so quickly sorted into flirts or battleaxes no david camerons calm down dear might seem a meaningless phrase but any woman who has worked at westminster for long knows exactly what it signifies its the verbal equivalent of a pat on the bottom unless you have been there day in day out you cant quite appreciate the male lockerroom atmosphere of the commons women mps remain a minority and have made only modest advances in changing the hours facilities and social networks that make life so difficult for them there are still only of them out of mps and the current cabinet contains a mere four a marked decrease from labours time in office so its hardly surprising that the atmosphere remains as the lib dem mp sarah teather remarked like a public school full of teenage boys dont get me wrong things have got better women dont have to face tory mps wiggling their hands under imaginary breasts and mouthing melons when they get up to speak as labours barbara follett did when she became an mp in or gillian shephards experience when she arrived in to find herself called betty by an mp who explained he called all the female mps that because youre all the same its easier these were just a few of the experiences recounted by a major study of women mps back in the new suffragettes by boni sones some thought yvette cooper was camerons target she wasnt but she knows all about the genteel putdowns in the palace she told sones that when she first arrived and asked for directions a doorkeeper said to her no dear who do you work for when she explained that she was an mp he was so shocked and so apologetic estelle morris had a similar experience when an mp asked whether she was a researcher or secretary i said no im a member of parliament and he froze absolutely froze its in the context of all this history the sexual banter in westminster bars and the way women struggle to get heard on the hard issues of economics and industry that irritation at camerons throwaway remark has to be understood his target at yesterdays prime ministers questions angela eagle told me afterwards that it was an unusual putdown which she thought had caused cameron some damage you dont get too much sexism but you do get it a bit on economic issues because people dont expect women to bandy around economic statistics i am used to being patronised a bit by blokes im used to it its water off a ducks back water off a ducks back is how some women mps describe the routine insults thrown at them by the sketchwriters inevitably their dress is more varied than the row upon row of men in grey suits so its hardly surprising that their looks attract comments ive noticed that some of the new women mps are adopting what you might call the alphafemale response louder shoutier just tougher think of nadine dorries louise bagshawe margot james harriet baldwin in the tories and stella creasy liz kendall and rachel reeves on the labour side theres a definite new tendency around a powerdressed kickass group of female mps some come from business some from the

have a tendency not to be so involved quite often and theyre not so ambitious in business as men because theyve got better things to do he told the sunday telegraph quite often they like bringing up their children and all sorts of other things yes other things pretty things such as filing our stiletto heels and practising wellaimed karate kicks in the direction of murrays gentlemanly bits do you think he continued that means when i rush out what im absolutely desperate to have is young women who are about to get married in my company and that i really need them on board because i know theyre going to get pregnant and theyre going to go off for nine months a brief reminder ftse companies have no female directors and nearly half of all ftse companies do not have a single woman in the boardroom earlier this year a government inquiry proposed that ftse companies aim for a minimum of female boardroom representation by though it fell short of introducing a mandatory quota as france spain and norway have done there are so very many objectionable things about murrays way of thinking first it assumes that all women want to have children second that fathers should not be as involved in the raising of their children and third that the masculine mode of business practice is the only way when frankly we might as well say men shouldnt be in the boardroom because they bobbinsed it up

those of us old enough to remember erin pizzeys first womens refuge in hammersmith in the s will need little persuading that wife abuse at that time was to a considerable degree a product of a patriarchal society for brevity i will use husband and wife as shorthand for male and female partners husbands used violence as a method of exerting control because they had been socialised to be dominant in families using that means in some subcultures and ethnic groups this is still the norm less often discussed is the problem of husband abuse problems of definition and sampling make it hard to be precise but about of husbands are victims of physical abuse of wives it is true that in large random nationally representative samples rates of male and female violence are often equivalent and some studies have even reported higher rates of femaleperpetration than maleperpetration but this is including nonphysical abuse male violence is much more likely to be physically severe that is criminal levels often requiring hospital outpatient visits the main methods that partners use to violate each other are physical abuse kicking punching and slapping sexual abuse threats of these and emotional abuse such as intimidation shaming and controlling through guilt or manipulation that husbands use severe physical methods more should not distract from the damage done by wives psychological abuse the most damaging kinds of abuse are severe physical violence usually by men and what is called intimate terrorism the wish to exert total control over ones partner although they often go together intimate terrorism is the main abusive pattern by women they may be pathologically jealous hypercritical of the mans every utterance or deed oversensitive that he is showing her up and closely monitoring all his relationships to the point of obsessive spying even when he is faultless they may rage threaten and tyrannise him for hours or days on end the effects of abuse seem to be the same for both genders nor do there seem to be differences in the form of abuse or its consequences in samesex couples the most extreme cases cause posttraumatic stress disorder where traumatic events are constantly replayed in the mind in around a fifth of cases situations or places associated with the trauma are phobically avoided and the sufferer may find themselves in a state of permanent fear that it will happen again depression suicidal ideas and anger are more common reactions in a sample of survivors of physical abuse of men of women reported feeling angry women emotionally hurt and women sad and depressed abusive behaviour is much more common in people with emotional or substanceabuse problems alcohol and especially cocaine it is also strongly linked to having been badly maltreated in childhood and to having witnessed severe parental disharmony whether there is more husband abuse today than in or whether less wife abuse is not known for what it is worth my guess would be that as womens behaviour has become more like mens more drink drugs narcissism and competitiveness there might be more husband abuse alas as men have not become much more like

as the director of public prosecutions keir starmer is responsible for prosecutions legal issues and criminal justice policy since he took up the post in november he has had to contend with the case of the death of ian tomlinson at the g summit the controversy around assisted suicide and has been drawn into the news of the world phone hacking scandal now he faces another challenge last autumn a yearold mother began an eightmonth prison sentence for falsely retracting a rape allegation against her husband despite the court accepting that she had suffered prolonged domestic abuse and had withdrawn the rape accusation under pressure from her husband news of the case triggered outrage and the woman was later freed by the court of appeal with the lord chief justice lord judge commenting that there should be a broad measure of compassion for women who had already been victimised to avoid the possibility of any repetition starmer has since december requested that all perverting the course of justice cases that involve retracted rape and domestic violence allegations should be submitted to him for approval the nature of rape as a crime that usually occurs in private with only the victim as a witness makes it challenging to prosecute how to handle allegations of rape that are subsequently retracted by the victim is an equally fraught part of law when is it in the public interest to prosecute the woman for perverting the course of justice recognising that mistakes have been made starmer has drawn up interim guidance published in february to help prosecutors establish where the public interest lies in this delicate area over the past month he has had two detailed consultation sessions with around domestic violence and rape support groups to be sure that their concerns are reflected in the guidelines and the public has until may to register its thoughts on the crown prosecution service cps website his main objective he says is to ensure that victims have sufficient confidence in the system to report the crime confidence is really important here general public confidence but more importantly confidence among victims to come forward he says we prosecute about rape cases a year and most of the time it is done really well but when things go wrong it attracts a lot of publicity malicious since he began reviewing files of evidence he has seen new cases involving charges of perverting the course of justice in relation to retractions of domestic violence and rape allegations he and his staff have to establish whether the original accusation has been retracted because it was malicious or because the woman who made the accusation has come under pressure from a violent abusive partner if there is evidence to suggest that the woman has withdrawn an allegation concerning a rape or an act of domestic violence that actually happened then the new guidance makes it clear that no case for perverting the course of justice should be brought it states the prosecutor should be aware that victims of domestic violence may sometimes retract a true allegation for example as a result of pressure fear of violence or intimidation or because of other factors such as a desire to give the relationship another chance it adds that anyone who deliberately makes a false allegation may be guilty of perverting the course of justice but clarifies crucially that the prosecution must prove that the allegation was in fact false if there is any question as to whether the original allegation might in fact have been true then there is not a realistic prospect of conviction and no charge of perverting the course of justice should be brought we tried as a policy to draw a line between malicious falsehood cases on the one hand and on the other cases where it may be that the allegation is true starmer says unless you can prove to criminal standards that the allegation is false then we are not going to be taking a case for perverting the course of justice to do that prosecutors will be encouraged to study medical evidence listen to the call recording and examine cctv footage underlying all this we want to give complainants the confidence to come forward in the knowledge that only if it is a deliberate lie are you likely to face perverting the course of justice charges youre not going to be facing them because you werent supported or because you retracted under pressure for other reasons he says if people fear that if they dont see it all the way through they might be prosecuted then that is not helpful and that is critically what we need to address the guidance will not make the law more lenient towards those who make up allegations of rape where there is a deliberate falsehood where someone is falsely and wrongly accused of rape and it is baseless then we will prosecute particularly where they the accused have been arrested charged and tried he says but even here the guidance is nuanced one case where the allegation was retracted and later turned out to be false involved a girl and a boy aged he says so you have this really tricky situation for a yearold boy to be accused of rape and for everyone to know about it it is pretty awful for him and his family but she was of a similar age we didnt prosecute there was enough evidence but the question was whether a prosecution was in the public interest he says the guidance offers help on what factors might reduce the public interest in prosecuting taking into account for example whether the suspect appears not fully to have understood the seriousness of making a false allegations bearing in mind his or her age and maturity starmer is also focusing on the way the cps handles domestic violence generally last week the home office announced automatic multiagency reviews for every death as a result of domestic abuse in order to try to learn the lessons from it and starmer promised more support for victims a million women experience domestic violence year on year we are still seeing two women killed every week by their partners women are more at risk of sexual violence from their partners than from anyone else women are more at risk from violent crime in their own home than anywhere else so it needs to remain a priority for us he says cuts the cps is facing a cut over four years and starmer says these cuts are forcing him to focus attention on deciding what should be the services key priorities the spending review last year was one of the toughest this organisation has had to endure we are restructuring and trying to make our team more resilient but i thought we needed to think to be clear what our priorities were he says im determined that the budget cuts will not affect our service to victims of sexual offences and domestic abuse neither he nor his colleagues will spell out which areas are becoming less of a priority as a result starmers message seems to be that whatever does lose out as a result of financial pressures it wont be this area behind his determination lies a sense that success rates are still not good enough but he stresses that the system is improving ten years ago we were still in the era of saying its just a domestic now there are many more cases of domestic violence brought than even five years ago the change in mindset came when we said to prosecutors when you are building the case assume from the outset that you might end up with a woman who wont support the prosecution now prosecutors are guided to get photographs or videos of the scene and secure the recording it really does make a difference the conviction rate used to be only only one out of two cases now it is up at he says the tape is critical once thats served the likelihood of a guilty plea goes up dramatically very often

a group of tokyo economists have discovered that married couples take it in turns to win an argument while the unmarried just trample all over each other couples were asked if they would rather go to the theatre or for a meal and if they would prefer gokarting to dancing where the pair differed boffins monitored the pattern of compromise i use the word boffin sarcastically since any couple agreeing to gokart would clearly be anyway there it is marriage either confers or proves a more mature evenhanded attitude but i have a problem with the methodology which im going to illustrate with this argument from within the atavistic lord of the fliesfest that is my unmarried relationship my beloved and i were arguing over who was the aggressor and who the victim between our two offspring this is the starter argument he decided that to save time he was going to adopt the unspoken practice of rugby where transgression is so complicated that the referee just gives out penalties in turns i countered that since they were two small children and not huge men it shouldnt be beyond the wit of a moderately competent adult to see which one had started it this is the correct argument he said it was actually huge men this is the diversion argument and if i spent less time watching the children and more time watching telly i would improve my sporting knowledge across the board this is an attempt to argue away the opening parameters of the argument he went on to argue that while there were more men in rugby than we had children they had only one ball where we had about m toys this is totally irrelevant from this we can abstract the following real arguments in couples are seldom between two competing and equivalent positions one is usually right where the other is wrong so to adopt a convention of turntaking would be random and against reason whether you were married or not i dont know about you but i simply cant limit myself to being right only one time in two,2011-04,group tokyo economist discovered married couple take turn win argument unmarried trample couple asked would rather go theatre meal would prefer gokarting dancing pair differed boffin monitored pattern compromise use word boffin sarcastically since couple agreeing gokart would clearly anyway marriage either confers prof mature evenhanded attitude problem methodology im going illustrate argument within atavistic lord fliesfest unmarried relationship beloved arguing wa aggressor victim two offspring starter argument decided save time wa going adopt unspoken practice rugby transgression complicated referee give penalty turn countered since two small child huge men shouldnt beyond wit moderately competent adult see one started correct argument said wa actually huge men diversion argument spent less time watching child time watching telly would improve sporting knowledge across board attempt argue away opening parameter argument went argue men rugby child one ball toy totally irrelevant abstract following real argument couple seldom two competing equivalent position one usually right wrong adopt convention turntaking would random reason whether married dont know simply cant limit right one time two,"['group', 'tokyo', 'economist', 'discovered', 'married', 'couple', 'take', 'turn', 'win', 'argument', 'unmarried', 'trample', 'couple', 'asked', 'would', 'rather', 'go', 'theatre', 'meal', 'would', 'prefer', 'gokarting', 'dancing', 'pair', 'differed', 'boffin', 'monitored', 'pattern', 'compromise', 'use', 'word', 'boffin', 'sarcastically', 'since', 'couple', 'agreeing', 'gokart', 'would', 'clearly', 'anyway', 'marriage', 'either', 'confers', 'prof', 'mature', 'evenhanded', 'attitude', 'problem', 'methodology', 'im', 'going', 'illustrate', 'argument', 'within', 'atavistic', 'lord', 'fliesfest', 'unmarried', 'relationship', 'beloved', 'arguing', 'wa', 'aggressor', 'victim', 'two', 'offspring', 'starter', 'argument', 'decided', 'save', 'time', 'wa', 'going', 'adopt', 'unspoken', 'practice', 'rugby', 'transgression', 'complicated', 'referee', 'give', 'penalty', 'turn', 'countered', 'since', 'two', 'small', 'child', 'huge', 'men', 'shouldnt', 'beyond', 'wit', 'moderately', 'competent', 'adult', 'see', 'one', 'started', 'correct', 'argument', 'said', 'wa', 'actually', 'huge', 'men', 'diversion', 'argument', 'spent', 'less', 'time', 'watching', 'child', 'time', 'watching', 'telly', 'would', 'improve', 'sporting', 'knowledge', 'across', 'board', 'attempt', 'argue', 'away', 'opening', 'parameter', 'argument', 'went', 'argue', 'men', 'rugby', 'child', 'one', 'ball', 'toy', 'totally', 'irrelevant', 'abstract', 'following', 'real', 'argument', 'couple', 'seldom', 'two', 'competing', 'equivalent', 'position', 'one', 'usually', 'right', 'wrong', 'adopt', 'convention', 'turntaking', 'would', 'random', 'reason', 'whether', 'married', 'dont', 'know', 'simply', 'cant', 'limit', 'right', 'one', 'time', 'two']",14
you go on a date pizza leads to crpe which leads to a nice pub you go to regularly its all going so well a second date is agreed before dinner is over this was my experience upon first meeting james bull last wednesday enjoying each others company in the john snow pub in londons soho we kissed however someone claiming to be the landlord asked us to stop and after polite words were exchanged we went back to talking the rest of the evening went well until we were asked to leave by the landlady she said our kissing was bothering other customers we eventually left the pub after being advised by a plainclothes police officer that it was within the landladys rights to ask us to do so i was shaking with rage i understand that people have different levels of tolerance to public displays of affection i myself do not enjoy seeing two people liplocked for hours in a highly sexual manner because i think that some things are best enjoyed as a twosome but i do not see what we were doing as anywhere close to that so while it is a shame that our kisses were beyond some peoples tolerances i think that certain levels of affection have to be accepted in pubs during the evening i also do not think we would have been asked to leave if we were a straight couple it would be foolish for the pub not to welcome couples enjoying a date especially in an area with so many romantic restaurants should two men kissing still be a problem in the uk in london today we have openly gay politicians where their sexuality is a nonissue we have television storylines featuring both women and men in happy stable relationships with same sex partners walking around most major cities you come across more than a few welladjusted gay couples i have been asked if it wouldnt have been more appropriate for us to visit a gay bar but why should we limit ourselves to places that openly state their acceptance why should we not be allowed to kiss as long as it is not indecent anywhere we choose im not frequently out in sohos gay bars i simply choose the places i know and am comfortable with it is important as we move away from decades of backward laws that outline the differences between gay

the pub at the centre of a homophobia row closed its doors as hundreds of people prepared to attend a gay kissin protest there the john snow in soho central london became the focus of unwanted attention when james bull and jonathan williams were asked to leave on wednesday night by a staff member who allegedly described the couples kissing as obscene williams tweeted about the incident which propelled him and bull who were on their first date to the attention of national media leading to plans for a gay kissin facebook event scheduled for pm on friday the john snow perhaps wary of the impending siege closed at around pm leaving bemused drinkers locked out on the street with beverages in hand according to one bystander about people attended the scheduled kissin which took place despite the closure of the pub and included bull williams and gay rights activist peter tatchell just after pm mass coordinated kissing took place in the street to whoops of encouragement from a growing crowd its still a victory said paul shetler a senior director at an it firm theyve wound up losing a nights takings because they couldnt have a bunch of men with tongues in each others mouths encouraged by a large media presence one attendee tried to pin a rainbow flag to the doorframe of the closed pub while others stuck flyers depicting men in various states of undress on to the windows while the event urged samesex individuals to engage in kissing embraces were generally in short supply although several participants made up for the lack of quantity with a large amount of enthusiasm michael peacock who described himself as a fulltime male escort and was sporting red leather trousers with laceup posterior was one of the more enthusiastic theres something really wrong if a pub will tolerate people of different sexes kissing but not of the same sex he said on breaking off from an embrace with a tall dark bearded man it wasnt as if they were having fullon sex the event had been in the planning since the early hours of thursday when shetler first heard the news of bull and williamss ejection through twitter bull a charity volunteer and williams a journalist for a financial magazine had dined in covent garden on wednesday evening before strolling to the john snow which williams said he was accustomed to visiting around once a week the date followed its natural progression but when the pair began to kiss they were asked to leave the pub first by a man claiming to be the landlord who said their display of affection was bothering him and later by a woman in staff uniform who said she was the landlady and found their kissing obscene bull and williams who were bombarded by news crews and wellwishers outside the john snow last night deny having behaved in any unseemly way the john snow has refused to comment on bull and williamss allegations while samuel smiths brewery which operates the pub has not replied to the guardians calls the pub shut its doors pm on friday according to natalie curran a yearold tv producer who was drinking at the john snow when it closed said the guy on the door said the landlord didnt want to stay open because of the number of people who might come the metropolitan police said it had not advised closure of the premises and there had been no plans for an increased police presence around the pub there was a small police presence at the kissin which spilled across the road at stages williams had turned to twitter to register his discontent on wednesday evening seven years in london amp ive never been made to feel bad for being gay min ago the john snow pub wf had me removed for kissing a date he tweeted his post retweeted hundreds of times spawned last nights festivities organised by shetler dont talk just kiss shetler wrote on the facebook event page using the lyrics from right said freds seminal hit in his guidance to attendees who were also advised dont buy anything but despite the guidance not all protesters were able to take advantage of the planned intimacy kevin wilson who described himself as the only wheelchair user at the protest was one of several disappointed with the lack of liplocking on show i sort of like oiled my lips up he said brushed my teeth chewed my gum but no he broke off from an interview to appeal to fellow protesters im ready for a snog anybody however the guardian did

its not every day that a womens rights group from eastern europe makes it into the sun but its no surprise that the redtop made an exception for femen last year its twentysomething ukrainian campaigners regularly go topless with flowers in their hair have worn bikinis made from surgical masks and even mudwrestled to draw attention to their cause since they launched in causing outrage among feminists and traditionalists alike yet today femens almost weekly protests are so successful it is planning to expand into europe founded by anna hutsol femen began as a campaign against the explosion of prostitution and sex tourism in ukraine sparked by the collapse of the soviet union in and intensified by the arrival of budget airlines and a depressed economy as its popularity grew femen took on issues as diverse as voterigging and the stoning sentence meted out to iranian sakineh ashtiani the next protest on april is timed to coincide with the anniversary of chernobyl when russian politicians will be visiting ukraine inna shevchenko a spokeswoman for the group admits no one was listening before they started stripping off at the beginning we were not protesting topless but we realised we had to do something really radical we dont have people to promote or help us or big money everywhere from tv channels to magazines you see naked girls selling something we are trying to say you should not show your body like that you should use it to protest and fight with a pool of topless activists local members and an estimated online supporters there are now femen groups in five ukrainian cities with plans to set up one in poland in time for the european football championship next year the groups tactics have certainly had an impact says ukrainian gender studies expert tetyana bureychak at the beginning of a lecture on feminism i asked my students what they knew about feminism and what associations they had with the word one of the first replies was femen yet many feminists point out that the groups tactics reinforce the idea that women are sex objects whose only value lies in their appearance a serious issue in a country where the prime minister mykola azarov felt he could defend his allmale cabinet by saying conducting reforms is not womens business so its not surprising that most ukrainian women are unimpressed by femen says bureychak they do not contribute to a positive representation of ukrainian feminism however there is certainly no doubting the commitment of activists such as shevchenko who says she has been arrested more than times lost her government job and spent nights in jail for her work with femen she is one of several fulltime activists the group supports through donations and the sale of its merchandise including pictures painted with their breasts like many of the groups members whose average age is she is a student in a country where one in eight sex workers is said to be a university student or schoolgirl men come to kiev in groups of for two or three days and go to nightclubs to pick up girls and do what they want before we protested no one talked about prostitution and sex tourism in ukraine she says but now all the media here and abroad show that ukraine is not a country of prostitutes but a country of naked girls fighting prostitution and sex tourism shevchenko blames the economic downturn for leaving women few alternative ways to earn money and wants the government to take action our government has done everything to develop sex tourism you dont need a visa to come here prostitution in ukraine is illegal but in the centre of kiev there are so many brothels and the police know about them and do nothing maria mayerchyk from lviv university stresses that femen is a positive radical and important phenomenon that is able to raise social issues and bureychak points out that femen is operating in the aftermath of a feminist backlash because gender equality is seen as a socialist preoccupation and too closely linked with the ideals of the socialist era as shevchenko says we didnt want to be traditional feminists womens organisations and groups here only write papers and nothing more we need activists who will scream and leave their clothes in the street,2011-04,every day womens right group eastern europe make sun surprise redtop made exception femen last year

is this really what a feminist looks like a ft in wrestler who once had a tooth knocked into his nose in a professional fight and lost part of his ear in another of course it is mick foley who spent years of his life hitting opponents with a barbed wire bat is probably best known for his alter ego mankind and an infamous wwf battle that saw him thrown off the top of a wrestling cage ft off the ground in now a new york times bestselling author thanks to his memoirs and childrens books the world has discovered a different side to foley the first glimpse of his political side was on jon stewarts daily show when he supported a yearold boy who was facing homophobic bullying by growling if i find out that anybody has hassled this young man i and perhaps a few of my friends will come to his school and bring a world of pain next foley admitted to a love of tori amos listening to her haunting songs he said inspired him before frightening matches and restored his confidence when he finally met her he was so impressed that he decided to investigate the antisexual violence charity she had cofounded which is how the mulletsporting fatheroffour became a volunteer at rainn the rape abuse and incest national network he started off donating money promising royalties from his latest book countdown to lockdown but realised he could do more he told feminist blog the f word im really hoping that ill be able to get more men to at least think about getting involved if i could pass along one piece of wisdom to the world about sexual violence it would be to understand that is far from being just an issue for women its a terrible crime that affects men and women alike foley who talks to survivors of rape incest and selfharm continued so many survivors choose to suffer in silence so that their stories may not often be heard by the males in their lives husbands sons friends but the psychological trauma of rape is so severe and the incidents so frequent that i believe every man knows somebody who has been a victim whether they realise it or not i probably seem like an unlikely advocate for survivors but i think we could make real progress on this issue if more unlikely advocates got involved now he is going one step further fundraising for the group on twitter and at forrainn offering to match all donations up to and even promising to cut the lawn of anyone who donates but not that he will do a good job and for a man who has spent his career fighting under titles such as dude love cactus jack and mankind he is now proud to have a new pseudonym the only

it is time to drop the silliness and the namecalling and approach this issue calmly how stupid are men no really i want to know slow dim mentally challenged or just plain thick how bad is it i am forced to ask because once again the male pill it is said is imminent around of men felt iffy about the feminine connotations of a contraceptive pill a similar number said they might forget to take it however just over half of the women were adamant they wouldnt trust men to take it why do so many women think that men wouldnt take the pill properly is it nothing personal women wouldnt trust anyone else with their reproductive destiny or is it because our attitudes towards men are so entrenched now the idea takes hold that they are surplus children rather than fellow adults feckless creatures to be organised and contained rather than respected bizarrely for the traditionally oppressed gender are women turning into control freaks there have been a few books recently fuelled by this idea of men as big hairy babies who cantwont grow up one of the latest and creepiest is this is not the story you think it is by laura munson a true story about how a woman dealt with her husbands midlife crisis he tells her he hates her and wants to leave she tells him that she does not accept that their relationship is over and she will give him the distance he needs distance she means to act like a pig after months of piggy behaviour munson sees midlife hubby getting his satellite upgraded and realises that everything is going to be all right a guy that has ordered more sports channels he is not going anywhere she exults hmm the psychoemotional mechanisms of the modern male deciphered via the medium of hour baseball coverage hallelujah munsons book is being billed as a happy ending but i cant see it was she being a good wife or a displaced mother a controlling passiveaggressive mother at that now listen little boy im going to stay calm and let you have your silly tantrum and then youre going to want your treats back and youre going to come back to mama and youre going to behave it wouldnt matter so much but variations on this men are just children theme have become the norm who doesnt know a woman who cant trust her man to do anything right theyre the kind who endlessly flutter about tutting and sighing organising stressing fuming what is this relentless domestic twitching about do we really think that left to their own devices men would leave the house with their underpants pulled up over their trousers do we seriously believe that they couldnt take a daily pill are men with serious medical conditions falling dead in our streets because theyre too dumb for pilltaking at one time i would have agreed on autopilot that the contraceptive pill was too important to trust men with blah blah but really what have we got to lose nothing is stopping women from continuing to use their own contraception as backup at the very least a male pill would put a halt to all the misogynistic horror stories of entrapment right now if a woman meets a new man and wants to test his true attitudes all she has to do is start a discussion about women who fall pregnant on purpose in a depressing number of cases the mans eyes will darken and he will solemnly agree with this absurd theory that men are under constant siege from hordes of women desperate to procreate with reluctant hostile nonengaged fathers because hey thats the dream the male pill would bring entrapment mythmaking to a halt overnight it would also be an opportunity for women to unlearn some of their own entrenched bad habits namely prising personal responsibility away from men to the point where we control them and they resent us memo to all women out there your man is probably not a big hairy idiot who cant be trusted to take the pill if he is why are you sleeping with him a cheap flight to spain oh darling you shouldnt have poor samantha cameron whisked off to granada for her th birthday only to have it deemed politically expedient to fly over with ryanair this is comedy crack to the media cue a thousand jokes about speedy boarding on arrival she has to suffer her husband dressing like darts player phil the power taylor blokeishly using the cashpoint all the time shes probably fielding shrieking phone calls from downing street dont wear a dress that costs more than its just another example of doomed prime ministerial holiday syndrome power is a ravenous beast that will never let you relax ever remember the browns at southwold in gordon scowling like he had wasps flying up his trousers only the blagging blairs ever swung great holidays thanksypoos to silvio cliff and the bee gees samantha should put her foot down its only a matter of time before cameron comes waving national express coach tickets rhapsodising about the loveliness of a wigan sunset or so my advisers tell me its true that michelle obama suffered a marie antoinette backlash after her own fivestar break in spain bet she had a much nicer holiday though are there any more skeletons in the closet a yearold skeleton from the corded ware era unearthed in the czech republic is said to be that of a gay man according to experts the gay caveman has been buried with the head facing the female way and surrounded by pots and pans instead of manly weapons or tools it all sounds pretty conclusive so long as we are happy with the notion of stone age homosexuals being so little fun they ended up being buried with saucepans they didnt get a fabulously sewn bearskin or concrete kylie cd just some boring old cookware how very john lewis and drearily heterosexual up your game stone age gays is this going to start a trend in archaeological outings can we look forward to a new sexedup time team with tony robinson forced to muse over the possible orientation of every rib or clavicle he finds buried in peat then there was the recent religious outing of jesus christ again there were some persuasive arguments all that hanging out with large groups of men and sex workers a much closer relationship with his mother mary than was previously thought some big row about manliness with his dad joseph still its too easy to out jesus christians arent about to issue fatwas are they its telling how certain other major religious figures are left resolutely heterosexual gay or not one likes to think that jesus would have got a kick out of having his sexuality questioned years after his demise wouldnt we all indeed theres nothing wrong with retroouting except that the dead have no voice when

cyberstalking is now more common than physical harassment according to new figures due to be released next week with many victims finding themselves pursued by complete strangers online the first study of its kind to look at the extent and effect of cyberstalking taking in social networking sites email and mobile phones has revealed the profile of perpetrators to be radically different from those who pursue victims facetoface victims surveyed by echo electronic communication harassment observation at bedford university reported that their harassers were more likely to be a complete stranger or a casual acquaintance than a former partner another major finding was that nearly of cyberstalking victims are men past studies have identified women as much more at risk from facetoface stalking most of the victims surveyed were aged to although ages ranged from to with teenagers reporting social networking sites as the environment in which they were most likely to be harassed dr emma short psychologist and coauthor of the study launched last september with the backing of the crown prosecution service said the crime was not taken as seriously as it should be there is a lack of understanding of the impact of this behaviour one of the biggest questions was is there psychological harm worryingly a third experienced this not just stress but a clinical record of psychological harm there have been threats to kill they give the impression that they know where their victims live and can get at them physically there is a lot of damage to or loss of reputation people being compromised by false allegations i spoke to a teacher who was followed through chat rooms and the net by someone claiming to have met him through a child porn site he had a very supportive head but it went on for several years he never found out who or what their intention was another victim was bombarded with vivid images of violent rape it is often unclear what the stalker aims to get out of it other than causing misery and distress she said the pattern of harassment is different between male and female victims she said with men targeted by strangers more than women around of men were stalked by a stranger compared with of women only reported being stalked by a former partner compared with victims of facetoface stalking where around half are former partners according to echo the largest category of all victims where the perpetrator was a stranger did not know where they had come from how they were targeted and never found their of those who pursued them the survey founidentities one in five said the offender targeted them via social networking sites and via blogging forums only came from online dating short who surveyed victims though a questionnaire said while it is clear that a third of all victims reported clinically recognised symptoms of ptsd men and women often reacted differently for women the fear is of physical violence to themselves and then to their families or children for men they are afraid of damage to their reputation the population who harass online are different to the population already understood as harassers by the police and the legislators so the risks are unclear echo is launching a website at bedsacukecho which goes live on monday the british crime survey estimates up to million people experience stalking each year but there are no official statistics on the percentage cyberstalked last week mps called for an overhaul in the laws governing such crimes so that both stalking and cyberstalking is legally defined the protection from harassment act the law most used to deal with stalking has not been updated since the explosion of social media and does not include online stalking at the launch of a parliamentary campaign on the issue most victims reported that they were unable to get the police to take it seriously that police found it extremely difficult to gather evidence or were met with a lack of understanding of how best to use the law a report by the national stalking helpline due out next week national stalking awareness week is expected to reveal that more than half of all calls to the helpline are those who have been harassed online or by mobile phone harry fletcher of napo the probation union said that areas such as stalking through social networking sites and the use of the internet to damage reputations were poorly understood by police and not properly defined in law it is often difficult to get information from internet service providers and proving attribution can be difficult as stalkers have multiple untraceable means of accessing the internet fletcher called for a change in the law to catch up with technology he said there needs to be training for police and probation into the nature of stalking the nature of stalking behaviour and how to investigate particularly internet crimes it was terrifying it started with a notice on an online bulletin board he knew joanne would see her name her husbands name their address email and telephone number then to show he was watching small details about her family would appear updates her children had posted on their facebook sites with comments such as x doesnt seem to be very happy today a series of false allegations followed that joanne and her husband were paedophiles who had sold their daughter to him for sex that joanne was a drug dealer and had been involved in criminal activities at work the harassment consumed joanne and her family but police failed to take it seriously she says it was in the hands of a community support officer they just thought i was a hysterical woman he put us though hell it was terrifying one monday i got up and i couldnt do anything but cry i thought he was going to kill me they knew who he was a casual acquaintance with a grudge but it was only after attacks on their car began causing of damage that he was arrested and charged with harassment criminal damage and falsifying an alibi the harassment charge was dropped in a plea bargain and he was sentenced to hours community service plus costs for criminal damage joanne wants a more robust law so that stalkers can be convicted and punished appropriately otherwise people like him will continue to be allowed to make peoples lives a misery what to do if you have experienced harassment or stalking advice from

a woman at a conference shouldnt be wearing trousers are you sure you dont have a dress sweetheart come on well buy you one do you think i cant afford it madam editor these very words were once said to me by a certain polish diplomat if someone had asked me a week ago if i was a feminist i would have hesitated not because i primarily consider myself a sweet thing or a human milkbottle on the contrary i have earned a degree and run a company both while pregnant and with my kids on my lap after i closed down my own business i was hired by the company of my dreams when i spoke proudly about being the mother of two children during the job interview the news was received warmly i thought to myself maybe those feminists are exaggerating arent there more pressing problems in this world that was until i attended a certain conference in my role as an editor it was a threeday event in a restored castle dealing with economic and social problems in poland and abroad on the first day i was asked whether i knew what i would write about on my return on the second day i was asked more persistently it soon became clear that one topic stood out demanding to be written in red ink or rather in screaming red lipstick women at conferences right at the start at the welcoming session two gentlemen were talking about how their sons were finishing law school and following in their fathers footsteps so i boasted about my kids they are three and four years old and madam editor just abandoned them like that for three days worried one of the gentlemen my response was of course i abandoned them leaving them to fall prey to their doting father oh then he is most certainly running to grandma to save him pronounced gentleman number two it was also remarked that in spite of my modest appearance i evidently have plenty of experience in making children which seemed somewhat interesting to the gentlemen during the conference when we were driving from one venue to another in a taxi i also made the mistake of referring to our prime minister as tusk in a casual conversation with some of the gentlemen in attendance one of them reacted strongly a journalist in this age should refer to him as mr premier donald tusk he was right i agree i respect the prime minister and even though in casual conversations in cars everywhere everybody has said and will continue to say tusk i have nothing against addressing him with his full title i just have one question why did the gentleman who pointed out my error in tact call me sweetheart and darling even though we had never met before and one more thing why did the company of gentlemen at the table roar with pleasure when i said darling back to my interlocutor that young thing is a smart one she thinks said the ohsopleased gentlemen presidents politicians officials directors attorneys and diplomats from then on they gave me knowing winks sweetheart are you sure you dont have a dress said gentleman number seven or come on well buy you one do you think i cant afford it madam editor this wristwatch how much do you think it cost me ten thousand and thats euros and what do you think is that a lot or a little well its a lot perhaps too much just not in euros but in the currency of selfcongratulation the banknotes are redneck red and only come in high denominations and they bear the likenesses of oh whos volunteering now why gentlemen presidents politicians officials directors attorneys and diplomats to count the number of remarks on my appearance that were made would make no sense nor would it make much sense to point out that no comments were made regarding the less appetising appearances of the gentlemen attendees i just want to mention a line i heard several of them say there are no free lunches i agree with that phrase gentlemen there are no free lunches and so what was the righteous indignation when i wanted to pay for my dessert all about no free lunches and i had to work extra hard for mine playing the role of the conference mascot feminists of both sexes i want to sincerely apologise and join you without you nothing would remain for me but to show up at the next conference in a seethrough gown with a deep zipdown neckline and a sign at the hotel door saying editor sweetheart invites you for a drinkypoo,2011-04,woman conference shouldnt wearing trouser sure dont dress

forty years ago in april the police closed down londons first overtly onewoman feminist art show after just one day on the grounds of indecency at first glance british artist margaret harrisons drawings fitted into the imagery that fine art and popular culture were infatuated with at that time comicbook superheroes and pneumatic vargasinspired pinups think pop artist tom wesselmanns nudes and the sstyle glamour girl sprawled supine on roxy musics debut album yet unaware of their double standards the police objected to the portrayal of men in harrisons work as demeaning there was hugh hefner squeezed into a bunny girl costume a beefy but emasculated captain america wearing false breasts and a stars n stripespatterned basque and valerie solanas the radical feminist who tried to murder andy warhol stamping on his brillo box artwork these images says harrison questioned the idea of having a fixed sexuality she has previously said the police were reacting as males to the notion that there were other manifestations of sexuality than the strictly heterosexual variety and that was threatening what was her reaction to the suppression of her work shock id been in a cocoon of discussions with other women says harrison who founded the london womens liberation art group in until then my work hadnt been in the public domain did it politicise her the events of had already done so but the reaction to the show politicised me more a new exhibition of her work i am a fantasy which combines late s early s pieces with later additions opens in london next week it will include a reproduction of the hefner piece which went missing during the original exhibition by coincidence hefner is back in the news a playboy club is to open soon in mayfair the last one closed in does this make harrison feel her efforts to raise awareness of sexism were in vain no this revival seems quaint just good retro business but its out of step with today my original bunny girl image highlighted the ridiculous idea that the only career for women was wearing this clothing you might want to wear this stuff now and then but it shouldnt be your only option lady gaga and madonna have used such imagery to great effect harrison is less well known than feminist artists such as mary kelly and nancy spero but is highly respected in the art world the tate owns seven of her pieces living in london in the s the antivietnam war protests and the american artists and writers who had escaped the draft inspired her as did changes in fashion and rock music and the rise of pop art my captain america piece was also a comment on the vietnam war she says other drawings examined the medias equation of women with food my work also referenced the underground cartoons of robert crumb eric stanton and oz magazine i was attracted to vargass style too but wanted to unpick it her s drawings crossed pop art with a nascent feminist sensibility and were spiked with mordant humour i was critiquing american pop culture but using irony rather than being militant she says her late s art was more political still she says rape a piece that spotlights the injustices against women in rape cases via newspaper cuttings and reproductions of classic paintings did challenge attitudes the arts council which bought it planned to show it at the serpentine but decided it couldnt because it was a family gallery with free entry so it moved it to the hayward gallery but it ignored the fact that it had been shown at the battersea arts centre where schoolteachers used it to introduce pupils to this issue some of harrisons contemporary versions of her s drawings such as an image of actor david walliams in drag suggest things have changed for the better with the notion of ambiguous sexuality becoming more mainstream i found an image of walliams in a magazine wearing a stiffly corseted vivienne westwood dress it struck me that in the west images of corseted women previously represented oppression but this picture shows acceptance of a range of sexuality we couldnt have imagined in the early s i am a fantasy is at payne shurvell london ec from april to may,2011-04,forty year ago april police closed

it is as you well know our way to rail against injustice whether at home or in libya or afghanistan todays is close to home good men and women cant stand by and do nothing our friend douglas carswell the very tory tory mp takes up the story if unpaid internships are to be discouraged i presume that the government will now put unpaid parliamentary private secretaries on to the government payroll blogs douglas over the past year an unprecedented number of mps have been made ppss under the coalition even quite junior ministers now make use of these unpaid ministerial aides an internship or work experience scheme mps appointed as a pps have to put in very long hours shadowing ministers in return for a better understanding of what it might be like as a government minister with an introduction to the world of red boxes special advisers and the thick of it like many internships the world over positions as a pps are generally not advertised and they are all unpaid we think its a joke but in any event its a cause for us we must grasp it yes it is not all fun and perks in fact being a political big beast is jolly hard work just ask the deputy chair of the conservative party baroness warsi big dave was in pakistan as we know but she was there too by all accounts she didnt particularly enjoy it she arrived back on wednesday and declared that her time in pakistan was good preparation for the root canal treatment she had booked for later in the day a day with eric pickles probably feels the same they need the money but one wonders how much the labour party will make at its american independence day fundraiser with ed balls as the star attraction even harder to see why they are celebrating one day late on july the yanks crushing of the colonialist yoke but it will be a classy affair as one might expect theyre holding it at planet hollywood on londons haymarket therell be burgers milk shakes and everything and just as the government is struggling to establish its credentials in the matter of equalities here comes david willetts to spoil it all by claiming that feminism is the single biggest factor to explain the lack of progress for working class men strange logic from the man with two brains but then this is not without precedent in two brains wrote a pamphlet on pensions where he argued that british women must produce more babies or there would be no one left to look after us in our old age he said british women must get on with it to boost the population and to address the fear of the different cultures brought by immigrants willetts pointed out that the replacement rate the number of babies women must have to keep the population stable is but the minister himself has just two he needs to close the curtains and put the babycham on ice before muslims move into his street not a moist eye in the house meanwhile as essex tories prepare to say goodbye to dr jason luty one of the more flamboyant of the southend conservatives he was thrust to power in having stated in his election address that his hobbies were being toldoff and hiding in the bedroom we encountered him here in then he was in trouble for allegedly sticking his tongue out and making faces at the opposition during a council meeting theyll replace him of course but they wont see his like again finally another day another mauling for a luminary lured on to the today programme yesterday it was danny alexander for the inquisition how to cope with the stress once they had survival strategies at the beeb as we see from an internal memo from a producer on the magazine programme the world goes by in in it he asks for a supply of brandy to be made available after unfortunate incidents in which one contributor became violently ill before and during the broadcast while another

mary knew she had a problem when she found herself screaming at her university professor he had caught her having an aggressive argument with a woman on her course and after several complaints from other students spoke to her about it all my life ive had a temper she admits i got into fights at school and university and would lose control over little things when the tutor said mary would have to seek professional help or leave the course she went to see the university counsellor it was a turning point for mary who had arrived in the uk at the age of while struggling to cope with the death of her sister it changed my life she says suddenly i was speaking about things i had never talked about how i was bullied at school when i first came to the uk because i couldnt speak english how months before i had watched my sister die my mother sent me back to school that day we never spoke about it again now if i get angry i can talk about it many are not so fortunate we suspect that anger in our society is reaching pandemic levels but theres very little help available says mike fisher director of the british association of anger management this january baam which operates a string of clinics across the uk received an unprecedented number of bookings for its courses despite january traditionally being its quietest month there has also been an increase in the number of website hits this could mean more people are seeking help but we know that domestic violence is increasing eight women on average are killed a month workplace stress is also rising and where theres stress theres anger he says in particular there has been a big increase in calls from people in relationships with rageaholics a person who is addicted to the intensity of anger and the adrenaline released an alcoholic has about people who suffer from their behaviour rageaholics are similar eighty per cent of our callers are people who are in a relationship with a rageaholic they are desperate and want to know how to convince their partner that they have a problem a recent baam study found that of the respondents had experienced verbal and emotional abuse in the last months twice as many women responded than men with more women appearing to be abused says fisher but both sexes report a disturbingly high percentage of abuses all of which doesnt bode well for the nations health anger can be useful but out of control it can lead to family breakdown and health problems says kathryn hill from the mental health foundation its report boiling point showed of adults were worried about how angry they sometimes feel and had a friend or relative with problems dealing with anger chronic intense anger is linked with heart disease stroke depression selfharm substance abuse colds and flu higher stress levels and negative relationships such as parental abuse rachel lampert associate professor of medicine at from the yale university school of medicine agrees it is well established that anger can precipitate a heart attack and arrhythmias heart irregularities in people already at risk although the exact pathways are not understood lampert conducted two studies in the first she gave diaries to patients with defibrilators so they could rank their emotions whenever they had a surprise anger was much more common in the period preceding the arrhythmias than in the control group then she asked them to recall ragefilled moments measuring the hearts electrical activity we followed these people for several years and found they were more likely to have arrhythmias later we need to take negative emotions seriously as a health risk but many experts say this is still not happening you cant go to your gp and say im angry and need help its not until youve committed a crime that you will be referred for anger management says hill fisher says early intervention is crucial the government has announced m to modern psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy but cbt doesnt get to childhood trauma which is the root of serious anger problems other experts say we need to learn how to express anger appropriately its about expressing yourself effectively and calmly says phillip hodson psychotherapist and fellow of the british association for counselling and psychotherapy common strategies include noting your arousal signs headaches foottapping tension and then counting to and slowing the breath and working out what you are commonly dwelling on in moments of rage and thinking about something else other tips include avoiding alcohol and drugs practising relaxation techniques and getting daily exercise exercise dissipates difficult emotions says hodson and dealing with someone elses rage dont argue listen and when they have finished ranting say calmly is there anything else then you can talk this of course excludes dealing with someone who is physically or mentally abusing you if you feel you may be harmed you leave and seek professional help names have

ive been a police officer for two decades and a detective specialising in serious crime and sexual offences for years never once in all the time ive investigated these horrific crimes has it occurred to me that one day i would be a victim that i would be raped and that i would refuse to help the police investigate but a couple of weeks ago i made a series of choices that led to me a heterosexual man waking up in a mans bed trapped underneath him being raped im still struggling to come to terms with how despite my decades of professional experience i made the choices that led to me being raped at no point the evening before had i felt at risk at no point did i think i was making a bad decision i also never anticipated using the service the police provide to rape victims ive always been the one asking the questions to be on the other side of the table has been a shock if i investigated a sexual crime now there are things i would do differently its hard to accept that a couple of weeks ago everything was normal now everythings wrong i had gone out with friends for a saturday brunch we were a small group of settled sorted middleaged men some single some in relationships but none of us looking to do anything other than spend some quiet leisure time together we had a couple of beers shared a bottle of wine over the meal then sat around in the pub chatting and reading the papers as the afternoon turned into evening people began peeling off from the group by pm the last of my friends headed home on a whim i decided to stay id never been in that pub before but i felt comfortable alone there after a while i got chatting to a group around the bar i got the impression that they knew each other and they were a friendly lot we talked about football music the state of the country it was good happy banter it was the chat that goes on every night in hundreds of pubs across the country when new people start getting to know each other as the night wore on the accumulation of a days steady drinking began to back up i was never particularly drunk i dont think but my memory becomes increasingly misty when i try to think back i cant remember when i first noticed the guy who ended up assaulting me but he stood out from the rest of the group he was more extrovert a bit larger than life but he didnt do or say anything that made me feel uncomfortable or that gave the slightest suggestion of what he would be capable of doing a few hours later i was still in the pub at about midnight then the next thing i remember is being in a house with the same group of about six people i have no recollection of leaving the pub travelling or arriving ive racked my brain but i dont know if we walked there or got a bus or a cab i do have some memories from the rest of the evening though i remember standing in the kitchen talking about christina rossettis poem the convent threshold it developed into a conversation about poetry and what we would want read at our funerals then my memory tails off again i dont think my drink was spiked ill never know if i was drugged or not but i didnt have any of the aftereffects you would expect i didnt feel disorientated or woozy my next memory is at about six or seven the following morning i woke up in a bed and that guy was raping me my first thought was what the fuck do you think youre doing the second thought was fear channelled into selfpreservation i jumped out of bed and grabbed my clothes from the floor it didnt occur to me to arrest him it did not even cross my mind that i was a detective my only thought was my personal safety he didnt try to stop me we didnt say a word to each other i ran out into the street i roughly knew the area so i jumped on a bus heading home and started the longest journey of my life sitting alone on that bus was awful my phone had died during the evening so i couldnt call anyone i felt alone and dirty i was very angry disgusted a bit scared i needed help i told myself what i know victims say all the time that it was my fault for putting myself in that position ive spent decades telling victims not to blame themselves but now i truly understand what it means to torture yourself with why did i how could i thoughts by the time i got though my front door i had decided i didnt want to report what had happened to the police i knew they would do a wonderful job investigating but i was thinking ahead to the trial with me in court as the victim i knew that anonymity at work would be impossible of course everyone would be sympathetic but theyd treat me differently how could i sit there with colleagues trying to be objective about someone elses rape if they were saying are you ok the whole time i knew i had to make sure i was healthy i couldnt go to a policerun sexual assault referral centre because there was a chance i would know the staff there the attack had happened in my town instead i found the public specialist clinic it was very good great advice great counselling great followup service i called in sick to work for a few days after the attack but i soon went back because i desperately needed some normality im not gungho i thought about what it would be like listening to the stories of other victims and arresting perpetrators how could i guarantee that i wouldnt suddenly break down what if the man who raped me attacked someone else how could i arrange for someone else to take over the investigation without it turning into a big deal my boss was also a friend so i decided to tell him what had happened i was clear that i didnt want to make an official report but he called in two other officers opened a case file and started an investigation i was horrified i said i wouldnt help but they kept saying they had a duty to protect one of their own i believe they thought they were doing the right thing but if id been any other victim my wishes would have come foremost they perhaps felt they could put extra pressure on me because as a copper i didnt need the careful handling we give other victims i was furious but dumbfounded the strain on me was and still is intense the sexual abuse team ask me to meetings where they say the same thing again and again we appreciate you dont want to substantiate this allegation but what else can you give us then they say theyll come back to me in a couple of weeks to see if ive changed my mind this relentless stress means i cant start coming to terms with whats happened to me i want to sign a closure statement that puts all this behind me i keep telling them that im not refusing to cooperate to be difficult i tell them repeatedly that i dont want to talk about it because it was horrible and i want it to go away i want to not think about it any more the worst thing was when they rang me late at night and told me theyd arrested a suspect i have no idea who he was and no idea what information the arrest was based on i dont know whether they found someone based on what i told them when they were chipping away at me or whether theyd found cctv film the coercion became worse they asked if i wanted to know his name that made me feel as sick as on the morning it happened they obviously hoped that personalising my attacker giving him a name and a face would make me change my mind then of course they had to ring me back later that same evening and tell me they were going bail the guy they had no evidence sufficient to hold him i guess they had two goals in seeking his arrest either id crack and agree to go to court or they could take his dna and check it on the database to see if he matched any past complaints my experience has led me to seriously contemplate whether i or other officers investigating similar serious sexual assaults put undue pressure on victims do we push victims to go through the court process do we do it for the right reason because we want to fight crime but in doing so not listen to what the victims are telling us the pressure my colleagues put on me was conscious but i think theres a risk that we do it subconsciously in other cases that worries me deeply another question ive had to ask myself is why as a police officer i am not doing everything i can to get my attacker off the streets but im a victim first and a police officer second im not the first victim to decide not to press charges and i wont be the last being a cop means i know the system and it has scared me off i know this case would be likely to end in court and from that point i couldnt maintain my anonymity i couldnt cope with the added burden of being a cop as well as a victim do i have more sympathy and empathy with victims after whats happened to me without a doubt has it made me more cautious absolutely but were always wise after the event thats not much good to me now,2011-04,ive police officer two decade detective specialising serious crime sexual offence year never time ive investigated horrific crime ha occurred one day would victim would

ahead of the launch of the governments social mobility strategy this week david willetts the universities minister announced that feminism has trumped egalitarianism not as one might think a longlost example of clumsy sloganeering but willettss belief that middleclass women getting ahead has robbed workingclass men of their rightful life chances it is not that i am against feminism its just that it is probably the single biggest factor and willettss cabinet nickname is two brains could we demand a recount even those of us struggling through life with just one brain could rustle up a few counterarguments poor education the welfare trap not to mention the decline over decades of manufacturing for one example the way my own father trained as a mechanical engineer watched that industry atrophy and employmentwise had to busk it from there one wonders why a conservative minister such as willetts prefers not to cite such factors its also intriguing how he seems to define egalitarianism as a male concept in direct competition with feminism getting back to those bloody women waltzing in and nicking all the guys breaks what we have here is a big social lie given a garnish of truth it is true that females from betteroff families benefited from emerging opportunities in education and the workplace it is also true that workingclass males have increasingly struggled and social mobility has stagnated for the past years where it gets surreal is the way willetts gives the impression of an automatic standoff middleclass women versus workingclass men a sociogender boxing match you snobby cow youve taken my life chances according to willetts the middleclass women whove caused all the trouble wont even shag the workingclass men how tight is that they took their life chances and then they wont put out its what willetts calls assortative mating that welleducated women marry welleducated men you suddenly had twoearner couples both of whom were well educated compared with often workless households where no one was educated so i do personally think that the feminist revolution in its firstround effects was probably the key factor hmm what willetts seems to be describing is the routine practice of people tending to couple up with individuals from their own worlds its called having something in common it does not adequately explain how middleclass women stole workingclass mens life chances nor does it help track the whereabouts of other important groups strangely absent from this discussion do workingclass women have no place in this debate have they spent the past four decades just keeping their feckless noneducated men company then of course there are middleclass men or is it that in willettss mind their social standing is not even up for discussion it is a given that middleclass men remain dominant indeed it is only after middleclass men get first dibs on what they want that middleclass women and workingclass men can roll up their sleeves and fight each other for the leftovers in this way you could argue that middleclass women versus workingclass men is a red herring middleclass men have been taking the lions share of everyones life chances then again you couldnt really say that because social mobility is too complicated what seems ludicrous is styling middleclass women as the nemeses of workingclass men there is no uppity oestrogen bunging up the system stopping the bluecollar testosterone getting through there have never been hordes of middleclass women pushing workingclass men out of the way to lunge at their jobs above all feminism and egalitarianism have never been eitheror concepts and its a bit frightening that a supposedly clever man suggests otherwise now this is a list you just cant resist how lame of david cameron to label ed balls the most annoying person in british politics at pmqs often parliamentary banter so esteemed in westminster doesnt hit the spot in the real world outsiders dont understand why grownups are engaged in the verbal equivalent of pulling pigtails my honourable friend is annoying no my honourable friend is annoying nerrr there are people in pubs across the land coming out with better quips than that after only a couple of lagers happily however this kind of thing also encourages people like myself to ponder pointlessly childishly but nevertheless enjoyably who would make it on to our own list of most annoying people in british politics top of mine would be nick clegg loathed chez ellen ever since that first hammy repetitive televised election debate oldstyle politics political pointscoring cleggmania my derrire next up boris johnson for once referring to black children as piccaninnies not so much annoying as ahem racist but boris is such a card isnt he hazel blears just came to mind for no other reason than that she is occasionally reminiscent of squirrel nutkin in a skirt suit to get off my most annoying list simon hughes must stop showing up on television interviews doing his handwringing coalition martyr routine i could go on so little space so many who deserve recognition for their services to annoyingness perhaps every single mp in britain would make it on to someones list somewhere perhaps that explains it the heady rush of reductionism egotistical politicos reduced to their true selves scabbykneed nerds terrified of getting picked last for games so much power and influence but they cannot stop us grading them in an eternal popularity contest perhaps best then not to actively encourage it mr cameron what have you done a

the universities minister david willetts has been criticised after making comments that appear to blame educated working women for the lack of jobs available to aspiring working class men willetts said feminism was probably the single biggest factor for the lack of social mobility in britain because women who would otherwise have been housewives had taken university places and wellpaid jobs that could have gone to ambitious workingclass men the conservative minister made his comments before the launch of the governments social mobility strategy next week looking at reasons for social mobility he said the feminist revolution in its first round effects was probably the key factor feminism trumped egalitarianism it is not that i am against feminism its just that is probably the single biggest factor he expounded the downsides of the admirable transformation of opportunities for women by suggesting opening up education since the s had magnified social divides courtesy of assortative mating whereby welleducated women marry welleducated men it is delicate territory because it is not a bad thing that women had these opportunities he said but it widened the gap in household incomes because you suddenly had twoearner couples both of whom were welleducated compared with often workless households where nobody was educated yvette cooper the shadow equalities minister who has warned that the governments cuts will hit women hardest called on willetts to withdraw his comments the idea that working women are responsible for persistent child poverty or youth unemployment in disadvantaged areas is just shocking david willetts should quickly withdraw this rubbish and face up to the real problems his policies are causing for young people and women who want to get on sarah veale the tucs head of equality and employment rights said its disappointing to hear this neanderthal take on our current unemployment crisis coming from a minister serving in the current government if ministers want clues as to what has held working men back they should look to their predecessors in the s hardly a golden age for equal rights who oversaw the sharp decline of manufacturing and other key industries however journalist cristina odone blogging on the telegraph site said willetts was right to suggest feminists were responsible for the plight of working class men but not because they have stolen their jobs feminists or at least the kind that have gained the upper hand in this varied movement have undermined working class men with their philosophy that all males are expendable this manhatred has not only been taught it has been rewarded successive labour governments have satisfied the feminists in their ranks by conceiving a benefits system that rewards single mothers who dont let the father of their children live under the same roof,2011-04,university minister david willetts ha criticised making comment appear blame educated working woman lack job

a hundred years ago tomorrow horsedrawn caravans drew up on wimbledon common carrying women who were to spend the night away from home to boycott the census with signs proclaiming if women dont count neither shall they be counted the suffragettes enjoyed a picnic of roast fowl sweetmeats and tea the same night emily wilding davison famous for her death on the racetrack two years later was sustained by meat lozenges and lime juice as she hid in a broom cupboard in the houses of parliament after a month celebrating womens history new research by historians elizabeth crawford and jill liddington to be published this month has discovered the two main ways that women used the census to protest in then much as now the householder listed everyone who spent census night on the property so the first method was to spoil the census form by writing comments or refusing to provide information the scientist hertha ayrton wrote i will not supply these particulars until i have my rights as a citizen votes for women in birkenhead miss davies wrote on her form the name of a male servant adding no other persons but many women dorothy bowker wrote dumb politically blind to the census deaf to the enumerator the other route was to spend census night away from home women walked outside hid or gathered at the home of a census resister we cant be sure how many did this their very means of protest obscures them from history but it seems to have been the more popular strategy in london suffragettes spent midnight walking around trafalgar square there was a concert of new music for womens voices unaccompanied and entertainment was laid on at the aldwych skating rink where members of the actresses franchise league thrust home the arguments by recitals of suffragist poems a vegetarian restaurant in covent garden stayed open to provide refreshments in manchester a large house packed with census evaders was renamed census lodge and women in portsmouth attended a reading of an ibsen play there were overnight events in cardiff bristol liverpool ipswich cheltenham reading and maidstone women met in edinburgh cafes walked on the yorkshire moors and hid in barns and hay lofts one woman put on her fur coat and spent the night in a cycle shed behind her house these stunts sound like fun but also took courage protesters some men as well as women expected to be fined or even imprisoned in the event no one was prosecuted the suffragettes claimed they were too many and the government was wary of taking them on after the previous years hunger strikes yet there was outrage a letter to the times described the boycott as a crime against science while punch joked the suffragettes have definitely taken leave of their census the research also finds that despite all the suffragette rhetoric the impact of the boycott was statistically negligible in fact a surprising number were counted for all their efforts emmeline pankhurst was listed by the hotel in which she was staying and davison despite hiding in her broom cupboard for hours was actually counted twice shopped by her landlady and discovered by a cleaner so they didnt ruin the census but the scheme wasnt a total failure one can feel in their accounts the exhilaration the suffragettes felt in this attempt to outwit the state taking a stand made these women into citizens arguably as much as the eventual change in the law the suffrage campaign was our eton and oxford our ship our regiment our cricket match as one participant wrote morning came and the census slinkers dispersed to make breakfast for

achievements of businesswomen her reason the company in question bluebella sells sex toys and lingerie bluebella grew by in to become a multimillion pound concern according to lovehoneycom the sex toy industry in the uk is worth about m and is constantly growing the company attributes of its business to women buyers their consistent biggest seller has been the jessica rabbit the vibrator popularised by sex and the city back in clearly a large proportion of girls and women masturbate so where are they all the trope of the masturbator is present in popular and classic literature film and music but women seem to take a more muted approach when it comes to practising selflove from adolescence through to the deathbed men are allowed to be unabashed onanists in modern times masturbating is seen as a natural expression of sexuality it is the subject of jokes the basis of entire novels portnoys complaint and movies american pie and celebrated as a natural and healthy exploration of sexuality available to men but there is no parity for women more often than not when women in popular culture masturbate it is often portrayed as a symptom of their deviance elizabeth

story with no photograph included we had orders in two days sight unseen we had a similar rush again after the sex and the city episode she believes that beyond the culture that still views women as sexually timid girls dont have the same opportunities as boys when it comes to comparing technique with boys its all hanging out in the front which makes it more accessible there are more shared experiences around masturbation for boys than for girls in my day it was behind the bike sheds though now its probably around a computer for girls things are a bit more hidden anatomywise and the images we see in porn films where theyre all so neat carries its own insecurity a lot of women still dont even know what they look like down there but things are changing hoyle believes weve had women

when my wife told me some months ago that she planned to take my surname i told her i thought she was insane in principle i am of course very proud of my name in practice it is the source of great frustration as it is endlessly mispronounced and misspelled youre signing up to a lifetime of hassle i warned recalling how accustomed i have become to having to repeating manzoor thats m for mother a for apple n for norman why did she want to replace her solid and easily spelled surname for mine the prospect of bridget sacrificing her name clay for mine felt absurdly outdated my wife is not my property and i dont need her to take my name for her to demonstrate our commitment bridget is scottish and i am from a muslim background and while not hugely religious i was gratified to learn that islam requires that muslim women do not change their family name upon marriage as this might suggest a transfer of property ownership according to pakistani custom surnames are not passed on in the same way as in the christian manner manzoor was my fathers first name and my brother has continued this tradition with the family name which his wife and children have taken not manzoor but his first name unlike my brother i have grown up entirely in britain which is perhaps why i was uncomfortable with this custom the question of how to show through ones name that you are married has led some to opt for the meshed option of merging surnames a syllable from the wife and another from the husband to create a new linguistically modified surname this felt peculiar and in any case meshing our names would have produced clanzoor which sounds like less of a surname and more of an especially fearsome foe for captain kirkdoublebarrelling our names was never an option as it would give the false impression we were posh or worse that we wanted to be a recent survey suggested that of men would be extremely offended if their wife didnt take their family name and a third said they would demand their fiancee take their name i was frankly not bothered and would have been perfectly happy for both bridget and me to have retained our original names while being a married couple my wife however was adamant that she wanted to take my name for some women retaining their maiden name is a feminist act bridget however felt that times had changed i dont feel subservient which is why i can do it she said as she slowly began the laborious task of informing her employer her bank and assorted others of her new name if it was years ago i would have felt the need to rebel and have insisted on keeping my surname so why is she willing to change her name she told me that she first considered it last year when we were both facing visceral and occasionally vicious opposition to our relationship from my family who disapproved of me dating a white nonmuslim my family were threatening to ostracise me and it seemed as if the price of being with bridget was losing my family this was as i later described in an article in the guardian an extremely trying and painful time when i saw that the other manzoors were going to abandon us i wanted to hold out the possibility of us creating a new manzoor family bridget said i wanted my name change to symbolise that even without your family i could be a source of emotional support to you in effect she wanted the manzoor name to evoke a positive hope for the future rather than only the unremitting negativity that we were greeted with from my family in the event i have only been partly ostracised by my family but it is not only the issues with my family that persuaded bridget to take my name i think it will be a great conversation opener she told me im going to enjoy having to explain why my second name is so exotic i suspect that trying to explain to the grumpy man at us immigration why her surname sounds a bit pakistani may not be quite as enjoyable as she imagines nevertheless i have to admit that her having a christian first name and a muslim second name is a powerful response to those who would seek to divide christians and muslims and suggest there can be no shared common ground so for bridget changing her name is a small gesture towards trying to create a more tolerant society i would never have asked her to do it and despite what the bank statement and passport says i still call my wife by her birth name each time a letter arrives for bridget manzoor i am still a little startled in time i have however begun to see how having a shared surname does create a stronger shared identity a sense that we are united it is often having children that prompts women to take their husbands name and the question of children and their names had been discussed before we even got married in my family my brothers children have his first name as his surname while my sisters children have taken their fathers surname the manzoor names future rested on any children bridget and i were to have fortunately bridget agreed that our children would take my surname but it was a purely theoretical question until bridget got pregnant recently we went to our local hospital to see the first picture of our baby at bridgets scan it was that which finally confirmed to my wife that she had made the right decision to have the same surname as our future child it was a name that began with my father and it was passed to his wife my mother to me and then to bridget there are now two mrs manzoors in my family one is a yearold pakistani woman born in a small village outside lahore and the other is a yearold scottish woman born in aberdeen those two mrs manzoors tell us a huge amount not only about the journey of my own life but also the journey of asians in this country a journey that like the name will go forward,2011-05,wife

katherine cabasanrose arrived in wales from the philippines thinking it would be a good steppingstone to the us a decade on she has a welsh husband a daughter and for now at least no plans to head on to america or return to her homeland casabanrose is one of many nurses and professional carers from the philippines who have settled in wales though nobody is certain how many of her countrymen and women are working in hospitals and care homes their arrival has swollen the number of people born in the philippines and living in wales to according to the ons figures polishborn people top the welsh table followed by those born in india germany the republic of ireland and then the philippines casabanrose was one of many hundreds of filipinos recruited at the turn of the century to help make up a shortfall of local health workers i wasnt planning to stay forever but when i got here i found i liked the place and liked the welsh people she says she did go on a trip to new york but found the people not as welcoming as those she met in cardiff and swansea and so stayed put the only thing she still cannot get used to is the rain there are vibrant filipino communities across wales the north wales filipino association is based in denbighshire and organises the north wales filipino basketball league and a dance group the association has also participated in the international eisteddfod the annual welsh celebration of music and dance some of the nurses have brought their partners over and started families in wales while others like casabanrose have married local men or women filipinos are now to be found in all sorts of jobs including restaurants bars banks and offices the figures throw up other points of interest there are an estimated germanborn people in the uk fifth in the table behind india poland pakistan and the republic of ireland in the northeast of england the germanborn population is the second biggest behind only india the german embassy is not taken aback the uk is an attractive place to do business and to study said spokesman thomas schieb but he was at a loss to understand germanys lofty position in the northeast table one explanation is that the numbers could be swollen by the children of british service personnel who were based in germany the number of chineseborn people in the north east making the group the fourth biggest may be down to a combination of a wellestablished community with a chinatown in newcastle and the attempts of business leaders to attract chinese investment there are explanations for other statistics that may seem surprising at first the number of us air bases in the east of england helps account for the large number of americanborn people found there sizeable communities of lithuanian and slovakianborn people are based in northern ireland as many have moved there for work over the last few years and in the case of the lithuanians there is a longestablished population in northern ireland there is also a large canadianborn population in northern ireland the result of ageold links between the two countries canadian orangemen march in the main parade in belfast on july cabasanrose is not surprised that

julie bindel time to end our gender obsession the reaction to the couple who have refused to announce the sex of their newborn baby highlights the way we demand that boys and girls be treated differently despite decades of feminism the canadian couple have told only one friend and their two other children whether the baby storm is a boy or a girl weve decided not to share storms sex for now a tribute to freedom and choice in place of limitation says the father hear hear as a radical feminist i want to rid the world of gender i am sick and tired of the way people insist on socialising little girls into pinkfluffy dolllovers and encourage boys to adopt the worst excesses of masculinity storm has two brothers who according to the parents make their own decisions about their lifestyle regardless of gender rules both have long hair and love purple and pink respectively most people assume they are girls why because boys should wear blue silly people regularly confuse sex with gender sex is the biological and physiological characteristics that define male and female gender is learned behaviour that society considers appropriate a set of rules laid down to benefit men and keep women in our place the minute we become aware of a childs sex we police its behaviour like crazy those who claim to be raising their children in a gender neutral way are fooling themselves after the birth of her daughter marianne grabrucker kept a diary in which she chronicled her childs behaviour looking for feminine traits grabrucker noted in the subsequent book based on the diary that many of her friends were in denial about raising their children to conform to gender roles and concluded that everything happened like a computer program set to girl upbringing differences between the behaviour of boys and girls are not biological truths but modern versions of old sexist ideas about how women should behave science is part of culture and is itself massively influenced by sexist stereotyping there is no such thing as a male brain and a female brain only brainwashing both women and men are severely punished for stepping out of line in terms of what is seen as appropriate male and female behaviour go into any schoolyard and hear the taunting of boys and girls who transgress storms parents i expect will soon be forced to reveal the sex of their child but for now this cute little baby can enjoy the freedom it has to simply be itself julie bindel writes on feminist issues oliver james dismissing gender is easier said than done there has been a grotesque overstatement of the evidence that males and females are born with different brains as cordelia fine has documented in her book delusions of gender the only biological certainty is that the differing sex chromosomes almost invariably result in differing reproductive kit and body shape the most comprehensive survey of psychological differences was by janet shibleyhyde of wisconsin university her metaanalysis of the metaanalyses showed that in a large majority of respects psychological differences between men and women are either nonexistent or small there is a case for not disclosing your childs gender to protect it from stereotyping while it might then naturally begin to display some of the stereotypes at least these would be coming from the child not imposed however there are several big buts leave aside the most obvious one that a child who goes into the playground as gender neutral will quickly be stigmatised the biggest problem is that identity is hugely influenced by the projections parents make on to children and that without these they are liable to lack a sense of self it has been proven pretty conclusively that children raised in institutions are often emotionally flat this is largely because of neglect or maltreatment but it is also caused by the absence of parents relating to them based on attributions of who they are as donald winnicott famously put it there is no such thing as a baby who a baby is depends on who the people caring for it project it to be and the way they express this through their empathic care an unavoidable component of the largely unconscious projections parents make towards their children is gender depending on their own experience of siblings and their own parents a newborns parents will bring all kinds of hidden assumptions to bear if told its a boy rather than its a girl when it pops out of the womb since parents cannot avoid knowing their childs gender these will strongly influence how they relate to each child however much they may try to override them and for better or worse this will enable the infant to develop a sense of self it is true that the gender can be concealed from visitors and strangers at least in the early years but the cost of doing so and of parents attempting to ignore their own projections could be massive confusion for the child identity has to come from somewhere gender is one of the bulwarks of social identity it is a fantasy to suppose every individual can find their true self independent of their relationship with parents and society unless you want the rudderless blank of an institutionalised child accepting gender as one of the signposts for who your child is seems not only inevitable but also desirable far more important than rejecting gender altogether is that parents

the following is an edited excerpt of remarks made by first lady michelle obama during an event in oxford with students from the elizabeth garrett anderson school of islington north london on may the full text of her remarks including the question and answer session that followed is available at the white house site most of all i want to recognise these brilliant young women from the elizabeth garrett anderson school my visit to your school two years ago that was my first solo international event as first lady truly that was the first time i went off all by myself as first lady and from the minute that i walked into the door of your school i knew i had come to a very special place it was clear to me that you all were so very special i was blown away by your talent you all put on a performance for me at the drop of a hat and i understand you didnt even really know i was coming but you put on such a performance and i was also impressed with your achievements i was inspired by your passion and your energy and i felt this strong sense of connection with all of you because in your stories i saw so much of my own story so i knew that the next time i came to the united kingdom i wanted to visit with all of the students again and i knew that i wanted to visit with all of you in a place like this look around i mean just look at this a renowned university that has trained so many of the worlds brightest minds and greatest leaders and im not the only one whos excited to see you all here today students and faculty at this university were eager to visit with you all as well and theres a reason for that its because all of us and its important for you to know that all of us believe that you belong here that this is a place for you as well we passionately believe that you have the talent within you you have the drive you have the experience to succeed here at oxford and at universities just like it across the country and across the world because you attend a school that has been labelled outstanding a school thats preparing you for whatever course of study that you might choose i know that you spend each day with girls from many different countries who speak different languages in your school so youre already learning how to fit into a university like oxford which has students from more than different countries and finally by overcoming challenges in your lives by adjusting to a new culture and learning a new language many of you enduring hardships in your own families through those experiences you have gained strength courage and maturity that is far beyond your years and those qualities will help you succeed in school and in life so in other words all of us who brought you here today dont just think that universities have a lot to offer you we believe that you all have a lot to offer these universities your talent your passion your unique life experiences and we very much want you to believe thats true as well and i know that from my own experience that can be hard sometimes and i remember back when i was your age trying to decide which schools that i would apply to and i remember how well meaning but misguided people sometimes questioned whether someone with my background could succeed at an elite university and when i was accepted at one of those universities i had all kinds of worries and fears and doubts before i entered i worried that i wouldnt be as well prepared as students who had come from more privileged families i worried that i wouldnt fit in somewhere so different from where id grown up or with people whose backgrounds were so different from mine but after a few months in college away from home on my own i realised that i was just as capable and i had just as much to offer any of my classmates i realized that if i worked hard enough i could do just as well as anyone else i realised that success is not about the background youre from its about the confidence that you have and the effort youre willing to invest and i want you to know that you have everything you need to succeed at a place like this you just have to work hard thats it you have to push yourselves thats the only thing this does not come easy for anyone everyone here regardless of their background got here because they worked hard and you stay here because you work hard but more importantly you have to believe in yourself you have to mentally believe that you can be here you have to paint that picture for yourself and most of all when you eventually get to a place like oxford i want every last one of you to reach back and to help others get here too thats one of the reasons why im here reaching back even as first lady of the united states making sure that other young girls get the same opportunities that i have maybe that means mentoring or tutoring young people in your community or maybe it means keeping in touch with students at elizabeth garrett anderson and helping them with their university applications because many kids dont have the experience to even apply and the one thing is that you dont have to wait until youve made it yourself you dont have to wait until youre big time you can start the minute that you get back to school because for every one of you here theres someone else from your school who could be here who wont have this opportunity so i want you to tell your classmates about the people that you met here today about the classes you attended here and i want you to get them all inspired and excited about what youve seen here today you all have so much to offer you have to believe that and i look forward to seeing all of you fulfill whatever dreams you have and i know theyre big so i want to see you all in the future visiting me somewhere around the world doing great

suzanne moore examines the rhetoric that feminism has gone too far and that there are problems in employing women quotas and womenonly shortlists arent popular but lets face it they work april she rightly points out that feminism seems to be wrongly blamed for everything from unemployment to busting up families and that any gains the government can point to are tiny when you look at the actual figures on the representation of women in public life for example but there have been some significant shifts taking place in their recent book christina ioannidis and nicola walther revealed that not only are women becoming the purchasing decisionmakers but we hold the majority of spending power and earning potential annually tn in consumer spending and tn in earnings figures likely to increase in the next five years moore quoted simon murray chairman of glencore saying that women are not so ambitious in business as men because theyve got better things to do he seems unaware that many women leave corporate life often because they dont see a fit between themselves and the male leadership so yes they do go off increasingly to set up their own business there were womenonly startups in the uk in given this entrepreneurial spirit moores view that choices for women are not expanding any more may not resonate with all women but what does resonate with us is the need for women in our social economic and political spheres to as she said wake up to what has really happened research we undertook found just how unwilling women are to help change leadership culture this research established that women with the power rarely use that power to promote the interests of women women dont use the power they have over suppliers to push them towards greater gender balance and women dont support quotas despite reporting that they know many women who are boardroomcalibre it seems that the laudable feminine oversensitivity to fairness and integrity is simply preventing women from accelerating change women are failing other women just as men are because of deeprooted attitudes about what is acceptable and expected of women we agree that quotas womenonly shortlists and any other positive action not to be confused with positive discrimination will work in helping to counteract past discrimination and break unhelpful stereotyping what are government and the business community afraid of the quality of leaders decisions is not compromised by having women at the table and lets not ignore the potential to increase a companys return on investment by appointing more women to boards we would echo moores view that the push for equality stopped years ago we have stalled expecting change in employment to occur naturally without intervention will result in no change at

dear ken your face was a picture of bewilderment as you were chased by tv crews demanding apologies for your comments on rape you clearly had no idea that you had touched a very raw nerve let me try and explain and tell you what you can do to put it right for years women who were raped did not get justice their sex life was paraded in court so they felt it was they not their attackers who were in the dock they were accused of meaning yes although they had said no they were told that their short skirts meant that they were asking for it their attackers would tell the court that women wanted sex in a park with two men they had never met if women were attacked by their husbands even if they were separated and their husbands had used violence it was not even an offence if the victim was a prostitute the police and prosecution wouldnt take it to court believing that a jury would never convict and so women who were raped felt terribly alone the failure by the criminal justice system added to their victimisation and sometimes reinforced in their minds the idea that it was really they who were to blame for the attacks so over many years we fought for change you are old enough to remember all this ken we argued that rape victims should be treated in a respectful and caring way by the police prosecutors and courts we changed the system from beginning to end the sexual offences act toughened the law on consent victims could go to one of the new sexual assault referral centres where their cuts and bruises would be tended and theyd be given emergency contraception and hiv tests at the same time as the forensic evidence was meticulously gathered police practice was transformed most notably by project sapphire in the met in the cps a new team of specialist rape prosecutors was formed her majestys inspectorates scrutinised all regions to try and spread the good practice judicial training was overhauled and the sentencing advisory panel issued guidance that rape was a serious violent crime deserving prison and when i was solicitor general i referred unduly lenient rape sentences to the court of appeal and they increased them and all that is starting to make the system change though it is still a terrible ordeal for a rape victim to report to the police and give evidence in court and though too many rapists still evade justice more women have the confidence to report rape and more rapists are being prosecuted and convicted the number of men convicted for rape has increased by your job is to lead the criminal justice system and to continue the improvement in bringing rapists to justice but one of the very first things your government did was to propose anonymity for rape defendants this sent out the signal that they need greater protection than other defendants because their accuser is more likely to be lying there was an outcry and the plan was dropped but you clearly learnt nothing because your comments last week were an echo from the bad old days earlier this year i attended a rape case in southwark crown court two men were accused of raping a young lithuanian prostitute the mets project sapphire had worked with the uk border agency to arrest the men the court heard incontrovertible forensic evidence from a sexual assault referral centre the victim gave her evidence screened from the eyes of her attackers the police evidence from the operation sapphire officer was unchallengeable and the prosecutor was utterly professional after a unanimous guilty verdict the judge passed an indeterminate sentence for public protection the defendants looked shocked clearly they thought that the rape of a prostitute was in one of the categories that dont matter twenty years ago that case would never even have got to court you should support not undermine the extraordinary and dedicated work of bringing rapists to justice you should be protecting rape crisis centres supporting sexual assault referral centres praising the pioneering work of the crown prosecutors and protecting the police from cuts that will hit their painstaking work on rape you believe that people who get it wrong can turn over a new leaf that is

i have been seduced and i have been raped and unlike certain french intellectuals i know the difference women do actually though of course there are always the likes of bernardhenri levy with his shirt unbuttoned just gagging for it while defending such lovely characters as roman polanski and dominique strausskahn when women say they have been raped there often follows an accompanying narrative of shame i feel so bad so dirty so stupid for getting into that situation we blame ourselves because the culture blames us i mean what possessed me to think that i could go through my on the road stage without that happening i should have known its different for girls right it all happened to me a long time ago and i am as angry at the law in the country that it happened in as i am with the legal system in this country what happened defines me less than many other events in my life thats a choice perhaps that not everyone can make should i give you a juicy description because this week rape is a sexy subject isnt it this is precisely why i wont the most salient detail is that the rapist struggled to maintain an erection this is not uncommon there will be people reading this who will respond saying things such as i am not surprised because some morons still think rape is about sexual attractiveness and desire some people think rape is just taking things a little bit too far rather than a form of social control a way of keeping women in their place so was i very seriously raped or less seriously raped he was a stranger after all is that more traumatising than being raped by someone who is meant to care about you i dont know i am not every woman we are all different some men force sex on the women they love on a regular basis most women i know have had an experience of this happening at least once most have never gone to the police i have always hated the expression date rape because usually no dates are involved rape is rape but rape is not a partypolitical issue and i am fairly disgusted that it has been treated that way this week ken clarke may have revealed some antediluvian attitudes but he is practically andrea dworkin compared to someone such as john redwood and much of what he said was right those who have attacked him have not done women any favours yes in terms of the law some rapes are more serious than others sentencing and punishment vary according to circumstances and aggravating factors lack of evidence is a key problem pretty much everyone agrees that our conviction rates for rape are appallingly low and the system has to change where then do we start with those changes it is easier to ask for clarkes resignation and imagine that someone with a magnificently righton agenda will replace him than actually ask what we might do to change attitudes look at the sun coming on all caring for rape victims on its front page and its pair of pert breasts on the next the calls for clarkes head on a plate are not coming out of a sudden feminist solidarity but because the rightwing dont like clarke ed miliband demanding his resignation was another cheap shot this is shortterm point scoring and little to do with preventing rape it is a terrible shame that just before this government got in baroness stern did a review that has now been ignored most of what she recommended was precisely about trying to improve rates of reporting prosecutions and convictions all we have had from this government so far was the bizarre proposal from the lib dems about waiving anonymity for victims which was thankfully thrown out if you want to see that failed policy in action you have now only to look at the french again with their sophisticated understanding of privacy and affairs in the strausskahn case they have named the victim and her child and talked about her looks her breasts and her buttocks as if rape is a crime committed only against white supermodels what clarke was buffoonishly trying to express was an attempt to look at lesser sentences for those who plead guilty from the start prisons are overcrowded and expensive after all in the case of rape this is also to try to avoid the trauma of trial which for so many women is another further violation we dont know if this will work but we do know that the legal system requires reform this latest row scuppers rather than enhances the chances of that happening i have been quite astonished at the hypocrisy on display people who have never expressed any interest in this subject rape like domestic violence is seen as a dull wimmins issue a sad obsession of dour puritans have suddenly roused themselves have these people been tirelessly campaigning for rape crisis centres to remain open or women not to be seen as fair game because they have had a drink no but i trust they will now be pressing boris johnson to keep open the one small rape crisis centre in london as indeed he promised he would thats one small centre serving nearly million women what i would also like to see is men stopping covering each others tracks men who rape and harass women often have form and yet their behaviour is covered up i have worked in offices where known sexual harassers were simply moved to another floor of the building after a series of complaints one wellrespected newspaper editor once gathered the staff to tell us sexual harassment dreadful business glad it doesnt happen here but it did and does in all workplaces and of course it happens to the young and vulnerable women it happens in westminster it happens at colleges a tutor once summoned me to his study to inform me he had a wife and mistress but what i am really looking for is a girlfriend i dont believe his colleagues didnt know of his teaching practice every time a highprofile man is accused of rape or harassment or assault not only is there usually a backlog of complaints there is usually a protective entourage tyson clinton schwarzenegger berlusconi etc etc powerful men have powerful urges you see there is an argument that we should see rape as an extension of assault and not a specifically horrific crime it is not the worst thing that can ever happen a penis is simply a piece of flesh thats all but rape culturally is about power and humiliation and real or threatened violence my daughter when a student passed on to me a list of ways of avoiding being raped that her friends were passing around it was put together after interviewing convicted rapists what did they look for in their victims what stuck in my mind was ponytails they are easier to grab when you are doing your hair just think about that tie your hair up you are making yourself vulnerable have it loose well thats loose in many ways we all remain willfully ignorant in order to get on with our lives but our political impotence makes this the most opportunistic of crimes there is more than one way of imprisoning people and rape acts culturally as a form of incarceration for women always and for those men who do actually want us to set us free,2011-05,seduced raped unlike certain french intellectual know difference woman actually though course always like bernardhenri levy shirt unbuttoned gagging

labour mps are attempting to set up a powerful parliamentary committee to vet government policy for discriminatory effects on women claiming that the coalition has a blind spot when it comes to equal opportunities yvette cooper shadow home secretary said the justice secretary kenneth clarkes controversial comments on rape this week betrayed a lack of understanding of gender issues across the government and that there needed to be a democratic institution to act as a safeguard for womens rights cooper and fiona mactaggart the shadow minister for women and equalities will meet voluntary organisations to unveil the plans the idea is attracting support from both sides of the house it comes amid mounting concern about the impact of government policies on women and a furious debate over some of the language used by senior conservatives in recent weeks not least the prime ministers now infamous calm down dear comment the home office which includes the government equalities unit said that the government was achieving progress for women citing a m fund for rape crisis centres announced in january as an example theresa may the home secretary and minister for women and equalities is known to have been annoyed by clarkes comments on rape this week describing them privately as unhelpful clarkes remarks came in the week that government statisticians put the number of women claiming unemployment benefits at a year high as public sector job cuts accelerate research published on thursday by coventry universitysuggested that cuts to other benefits will cost women m compared with just under m for men cooper said that the coalition had a blind spot on women this is not just about revealing remarks be it from the justice secretary or the prime minister women are losing out every time from government policies she said there is a toxic mix of paternalistic toryism and laissezfaire liberalism at the heart of the government which hits women hard some still subscribe to the traditional tory view of women and family life and there is a deep and widespread hostility to state or public sector action from tax credits to childcare which help women get on the result is that for the first time in generations the clock is being turned back on womens equality the idea of a women and equality audit committee has already been aired in the house this year when some coalition mps spoke out in favour jo swinson the liberal democrat mp for east dunbartonshire said such a committee would ensure womens issues were high on the agenda claire perry the tory mp for devizes said it sounded extremely sensible the mps behind the plans are confident that if put it to a vote it would pass with a majority but first they must convince the commons authorities of the necessity for another select committee particularly when budgets are stretched in a statement may insisted the deficit was being reduced evenhandedly decisions to increase spending on health and child tax credits as well introducing flexible parental leave and extending the right to request flexible working will all benefit women we are also taking of the lowestpaid workers out of income tax all together the

even before ken clarkes remarks on rape universities minister david willetts had made the coalition appear neanderthal by blaming the entry of women into the workplace and higher education for the lack of progress made by men asked what was to blame for the lack of social mobility willetts said in a briefing for journalists the feminist revolution in its firstround effects was probably the key factor feminism trumped egalitarianism it is not that i am against feminism its just that is probably the single biggest factor the comments echoed a passage in his book the pinch in which he argued that while the expansion of university access helped both men and women it had a far greater impact on the latter he wrote it is of course absolutely right that women should have education and employment opportunities opened up to them which were closed even only a generation ago but the women who benefited from this expansion came from more affluent backgrounds the passage was based on research by anna vignoles a professor of the economics of education at the university of london who confirmed it had been interpreted accurately she said i would not say that the use of the word feminism by willetts is questionable im merely stating that there are two aspects to this one is positive the raising of participation for women the other is that rising participation came from more advantaged women it is absolutely right to point out that this widened the socioeconomic gap in he participation for women the increase in university tuition fees from next year is predicted to affect women slightly less than men because the threshold for repayment has been raised from to this benefits female graduates partly because of the pay gap but also because womens careers are more disrupted by parenthood then mens loan repayments are suspended when a graduates salary falls below the threshold analysis by the consultancy london economics finds approximately of male and of female graduates will pay more under the increased fees than is currently the case the analysis finds that of women will never repay their entire loan up from at present it finds that of men will never repay their loan the current figure for men is less than approximately of female graduates will pay less under the increased fees with the greatest benefits going to those women in the third income decile whose earnings currently lie just above the threshold for repayment aside from higher education there is concern that cuts in funding for english courses for speakers of other languages esol will disproportionately affect women from september the government will only offer free esol places to those on benefits paid to people actively seeking work such as jobseekers allowance the association of colleges estimates that students three quarters of whom are women on inactive benefits will pay fees colleges say many students will be unable to afford these fees which will range from to depending on the duration of the course the government has commissioned a review due to report this summer to look at the impact of the funding cuts ministers say additional help may be made available for women

it only took a matter of weeks for the new government to offend womens rights groups when it offered anonymity for alleged rapists in its coalition agreement the proposal subsequently watered down had not appeared in either partys manifesto and came as a bolt from the blue for campaigners hoping that the new government would tackle the low conviction rates of all reported rapes end up with a rape conviction by implementing already agreed strategies to help rape victims come forward instead its first act was to offer protection to alleged attackers not offered to other men accused of violent crimes although worthy of debate it set the tone for a government that has seemed hell bent on reducing the rights for women rather than improving them clare mcglynn professor of law at durham university said it was such a distraction when there are so many clear priorities and issues in dealing with sexual violence issues such as implementing police practice guidelines for dealing with women who come forward with accusations and the treatment of prostitutes for example and then this week the justice secretary kenneth clarke provoked this sense of injustice again not by suggesting shorter sentences for men who immediately plead guilty to rape but by using words that clumsily implied only some violent rapes are serious and that it is unwilling women who make them so clarkes comments about his desire to reduce the ordeal of women who report rape were welcomed yet victim support groups were also outraged that the effect of halving sentences for early guilty pleas could reduce sentences for rape to as little as months in between these two tineared interventions on rape there have also been changes to the equality act which watered down provisions intended to encourage local authorities to address injustice cuts to legal aid which adversely affect women and perhaps most importantly cuts to womens groups many of which address issues around domestic violence and rape a lot of these changes such as that over legal aid arent labelled as affecting women but when you look at the detail thats exactly what they are said mcglynn although there is some provision for victims of domestic violence to have recourse to legal aid the justice department itself said women would be hardest hit by the cut in funding for family law and divorce cases on an international level womens rights campaigners are also still waiting for the government to sign up for the council of europes convention of violence against women added to this there is only one woman in the supreme court with the two most recent appointments both being white men despite the coalitions adverse legal moves however mcglynn believes the biggest impact on women will stem from the budget cuts and the loss of jobs as a feminist i believe womens victimisation and discrimination is a societal issue and not an individual one so it needs a societal response its difficult for one woman to address inequalities in pay for example from its actions this government appears to believe that they can and should,2011-05,took matter week new government offend womens right group offered anonymity

perhaps this maledominated government needs some equal opportunities training one coalition mp says the latest row over clarke betrays an oldfashioned casual sexism even at the top of government they dont mean to get it wrong for political reasons they would love not to get it wrong but they just dont get women or the issues they just keep getting it wrong she says despairingly and yet the commons has never been more female last year women were elected the highest number ever and up on the previous election that increase came exclusively from an increase in conservative female mps the number of whom almost tripled from to benches on both sides of the house look younger and the tories at least are slightly more female but cameron has struggled to find enough senior female candidates for his government there are four women in the cabinet out of members overall fewer than of camerons ministers are women compared with of spains cabinet of swedens of germanys and of americas the exception to that rule is the home office where theresa may became home secretary amid suggestions mostly from disgruntled male rivals that she had been overpromoted because cameron desperately needed a big job to go to a woman compared with other calamityprone secretaries of state she has been a relatively safe pair of hands save a spectacular falling out with the police over cuts half of the home office

its hugely disappointing your editorial may backed ken clarke following the furore about his inaccurate comments about rape you take the view that his leniency on sentencing more than makes up for his abhorrent views on rape it does not you outlined the various distinctions ken clarke sought to make including whether all rape is the same and his views on so called date rape the legislative and sentencing framework makes no distinction between whether or not the rape was preceded by a meal or a few drinks the sentencing framework rightly takes in to account harm to the victim culpability of the offender and the risk the offender poses to the public theres no distinction between the victim knowing their assailant or not there are two common factors in all the victims of rape or attempted rape that i know personally they did not report the crime to the police and they had a prior relationship with their assailant one of the factors in the decision not to report potentially putting other women in danger is because women experience views like ken clarkes that not all rapes are the same and most of the victims that i know have initially at least blamed themselves in some way one point you didnt highlight is ken clarkes claim that rape hasnt changed since he practised law but hes wrong arguably the biggest change is that when ken clarke practised law it was legally impossible for a man to rape his wife judges not the parliament he was a member of changed this in its unacceptable that the most senior politician in charge of trying to increase rape prosecutions which includes surely encouraging victims to come forward could hold the antiquated and sexist views that prevent many victims from doing just that and its difficult to see how further progress can be made while he remains in post cllr sarah hayward labour camden council it is deeply prejudicial to any serious debate on rape for labour to distort and hype up ken clarkes remarks this is typical of labour blasting out of the water anyone who wants to discuss whether there are more effective approaches to tackling crime than their own undistinguished year record people in glass houses should not throw stones i did not have any problem with ken clarkes remarks and it is also entirely legitimate for him to consult on whether a bigger discount on sentence for a guilty plea would secure more rape convictions i respect those who disagree with this suggestion but i do not respect labours cynical playing of the feminist card by attacking ken clarke they are mistaken if they think this is helpful to actually improving the rape conviction rate and the lives of women sarah ludford mep liberal democrat london jane martinson comment may complains that rape is regarded as a different kind of crime to other assaults when the whole thrust of her piece is that she wishes rape to be treated differently to other assaults contrary to her assertion there is plenty of gradation in crimes of assault from simple assault through assault occasioning actual bodily harm to assault with gbh to murder and with sentencing sensibly tempered by the individual circumstances of any case the crime of rape is defined in narrow terms as unlawful penetration which probably dates back to when women were chattels whose value was contingent on their honour i would expect a feminist to view rape instead primarily in terms of being a particularly nasty form of assault and accept that there is potential gradation according to circumstance andy smith kingston upon thames surrey reducing the prison sentence of an alleged perpetrator of serious crime including rape by as much as for an early guilty plea clearly needs thorough consideration ken clarke has said it helps rape victims if there is a guilty plea surely it is time to consult the victim if the accused wants to plead guilty the victim should not be powerless it is time to include victims in the process of plea bargaining anne allison london we all know that the changes being suggested by the justice secretary are to save money however if we accept for a moment the argument that rapists will plead guilty because they will receive a shorter sentence may i suggest an approach that may satisfy that criterion do not reduce the statutory sentence under any circumstance but let it be known that if guilt is accepted as soon as possible then that will be taken into consideration when early release is considered if someone is found guilty after refusing to plead guilty then it will be likely that he will serve the whole sentence or near to it roy hogg nottingham kenneth clarkes plans to allow shorter sentences in exchange for early guilty pleas will be another stab in the back for those who suffer miscarriages of justice we already know that these people are badly treated in prison now the law is going to penalise them as well leaving them fighting to clear their names while the guilty are let out early pauline bagg waltham abbey essex i despaired of the guardian when i read your editorial most of the public will understand the difference between violent rape coerced rape unknowing rape between teenagers and the vast array of circumstances that surround the act of rape however the minister for justice should be able to articulate exactly what he means without digging himself into a cavernous hole we may all tolerate or even love politicians with character in runofthemill situations they may equally be well intentioned but serious issues require serious politicians he should go gill morgan doncaster all crimes can be divided into more or less serious examples which is why politicians setting mandatory sentences is always a bad idea take murder one of the few crimes that is worse than rape someone who

the raunch culture is corrosive and damaging to women asserted dorothyherself beneath last weeks piece by charlotte richardson andrews about rihannas sampm video and the pernicious effects of oversexualisation it presents women as objects to be fucked which is also how most porn presents women sex on the other hand is lovely dorothy was objecting to those who argued that the pop industry presents men in just as overtly sexualised a way as women like mendoza who wrote fiddy got snapped by rolling stone in his vest i wonder what the focal point was there so trying to claim that its mainly women who get objectified is obv plain daft when you consider the absolute mountain of goodlooking bodbaring boybands out there or elfojo who said i think complete denial of sexuality of any sort is damaging to kids just as oversexualisation is damaging yes i think in this specific context the balance is too far towards too much sex but not to the oh my god think of the children broken britain extent the author seems to imply bringing it back home was smith expressing what must be many parents fear i have a young son who i dont really want growing up seeing girls being portrayed like this rihanna puts across this aggressive sexuality singing chiefly about all the things she wants to do in the sack this is perfectly acceptable and i would never argue for anyones desires to be

opposed to senna and other films that perhaps take a wider canvas or look at sport on a national or indeed international scale even donovan a man still living by hippy ideals managed to provoke

a highranking former police officer who advised the government on rape for years has said proposals to halve sentences for attackers who plead guilty will make it harder to convict rapists and could deter victims from coming forward dave gee who was recently commended by the president of the association of chief police officers acpo sir hugh orde as the uks leading authority on rape investigation said he felt despair when he heard kenneth clarke appear to suggest some rape cases were more serious than others and accused the justice secretary of ignorance of the subject and the law the former head of derbyshire cid told the guardian that clarkes plan to increase the discounted tariff for rape when assailants admitted guilt to alongside crimes like robbery and burglary downplayed the severity of the offence in turn inviting officers to investigate it less thoroughly he also said clarke had got the law wrong when he claimed that a case of an yearold having sex with a yearold girl would be treated as rape even if she were willing in fact in those circumstances the crime would be unlawful sexual intercourse statutory rape is when the girl is or under in an interview on bbc radio live on wednesday clarke rejected a suggestion that rape is rape and talked about serious rape with violence and an unwilling woman gee who travelled the country advising police forces on how to increase conviction rates in his work for the home office and acpo said i couldnt believe what i was hearing when i listened to it again to check my hearing of it it was even worse then id thought it showed an ignorance of the facts and about rape in general he drew an obvious distinction between serious rape and other categories it legitimises the myth that proper rape must involve violence and injury it sends a message to jurors who have an attitude that there are degrees of rape that they are right and may make them less likely to convict gee said it was outrageous for clarke to get his facts wrong on statutory rape hes responsible for justice and he doesnt know the law on the sentencing proposals he said why is rape being included with what are currently deemed to be lesser offences it will weaken the investigative mindset of officers at the outset at a time when were trying to get more people to report rape this announcement will have done nothing to help and may even have reversed those efforts what are they thinking of he also criticised clarke for suggesting victims wanted to be spared the trauma of going to court saying that for many it was an important part of the cathartic process gee a retired detective chief superintendent for five years managed acpos rape support programme which worked with forces around the country to improve their handling of rape cases and drive up conviction rates he also worked with officials in the home office dealing with policy on sexual violence and cowrote acpos national guidance on rape he left his role in march this year

you might assume survivors of rape need all the support that society and indeed their government can afford them and yet ken clarke on wednesday delivered a special kind of blow to those already down with his astonishing statement that some rapes were more serious than others i volunteered as a telephone counsellor for three years at manchester rape crisis and we were never required to treat survivors of rape differently an hour of counselling for survivors of proper serious rape and a little less for victims of silly date rape certainly not we did not distinguish between types of rape because all forms of rape are exceptionally distressing for the survivor and all types of rape are serious through distinguishing serious and less serious rape clarke assumed a perverse gradient of suffering a warped taxonomy of perceived victimisation perhaps one of his gravest errors is that by choosing his words so uncarefully he removed agency from the victims with the level of seriousness of the crime committed against their own body no longer evaluated by themselves but by a politician date rape is already a woefully misleading and loaded term and it must not be characterised as a less serious crime instances of date rape are already received with dismissive attitudes which often seem to imply oh well she probably regretted it the next day or insinuations that by eating opposite someone in a restaurant you somehow offered your unbridled sexual consent it is no great secret that the sweeping majority of rapes are not of the maskedmaninadarkalley variety but by someone the victim knows does clarke believe this is a less serious form of rape when it is by your boyfriend your husband the father of your children disassociating one type of rape from another removes a small comfort many survivors have they are not alone shattering their experiences into levels of seriousness in the public discourse removes a unity survivors can draw strength from group therapy proves to be an outlet through which many survivors find support it is a setting in which they are able to explore their thoughts and where their experiences are shared and understood this outlet would be put in jeopardy if survivors experiences were to be widely marked or publicly referred to on a hierarchy of seriousness regardless of the circumstances surrounding rape survivors go through the same traumatic investigation the same demeaning trial the same stigma and a similar process of recovery clarke made these comments as part of a proposal to increase rape convictions surely the most important part of this proposal is ensuring survivors of rape feel comfortable enough to come forward without fear their allegations will not be taken seriously and that they will not have to compromise in order to achieve a semblance of justice clarke is calling for reduced sentencing for those pleading guilty are lesser sentences for rapists pleading guilty the most pressing area in need of change within rape trials and investigations why not propose extended sentences for those convicted who didnt plead guilty or address a dismissive and sceptical bureaucracy in which women saying they have been raped are largely doubted bargaining with rapists wont improve rape conviction rates confronting a discourse that enables attitudes such as these will one of the reasons why i eventually stopped volunteering with rape crisis is because at the end of one phone call there is always another and another and another there is a wider issue to be addressed here and its to do with what many have called rape culture its to do with widely held beliefs that victims somehow ask for it its to do with the adjectives used by clarke and having these opinions echoed by a senior member of parliament validates them,2011-05,might assume survivor rape need support society indeed government afford yet ken clarke wednesday delivered special kind blow already astonishing statement rape

ministers from countries all across europe gathered in istanbul today to sign a new council of europe convention on domestic violence at the istanbul summit of the committee of ministers incredibly the uk wasnt one of the signatories the british government so far has not commented on its reasoning but for a country that prides itself on being a leader on womens rights its failure to sign so far is both a mystery and a serious disappointment the uk government has been sending out mixed messages when it comes to domestic violence as jon robins has pointed out before on the one hand the home secretary theresa may and the director of public prosecutions stress how serious this violence is and how determined they are to end it on the other the government is nibbling away determinedly at those services that are needed to fight violence such as legal aid and protection for female asylum seekers who suffered domestic violence in their home country and now it is reluctant to sign a groundbreaking new treaty that will truly make a difference throughout the european region the uks leadership and support is important not just at home but for the whole region as my research about domestic violence in turkey shows born in southeastern turkey selvi was years old and pregnant with her fifth child when i met her while conducting research for a report on domestic violence her husband started his attacks when she was pregnant with their first child that first time he hit me he kicked the baby in my belly and he threw me off the roof she said in selvi her name has been changed for her protection finally went to the police after her husband had repeatedly raped her and broken her skull and arm but the police after questioning her husband at the station told selvi theres no problem we spoke to him youre back together this happened three more times i just cannot go to the police any more she said selvis story encapsulates everything that can go horribly wrong when domestic violence is not taken seriously the landmark new council of europe convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence offers a comprehensive international legal instrument to address this type of abuse and includes a monitoring mechanism to ensure its provisions are implemented implementation is crucial for selvis case is sadly not isolated less than five miles from the site where the convention was being signed zelal not her real name lives with her three children across the street from her exhusbands home one day he grabbed her as she walked out of her house she explained he held me i screamed let me go he started beating me there were a lot of people around us but nobody did anything he pulled my hair and covered my mouth and he dragged me to my house there he kicked me and i fell to the ground he broke every possession i have in the house every chair every picture everything then he took off my clothes and he raped me zelal managed to escape almost naked and went to two different police stations where she endured a barrage of questions from arent you ashamed to tell me you were raped by your exhusband to why are you bothering us with this she eventually managed to speak with a prosecutor but he told her to come back after the weekend zelals ordeal is one of many documented in a new human rights watch report on family violence in turkey the report documents the awful experiences of women of all ages in istanbul ankara izmir van trabzon and diyarbakr as they endured violence and sought help from the state women and girls as young as told of being raped stabbed kicked in the stomach when pregnant beaten with hammers sticks branches and hoses to the point of broken bones and fractured skulls locked up with dogs or other animals starved shot with a stun gun injected with poison pushed off a rooftop and subjected to severe psychological violence in turkey of all women have experienced such physical or sexual violence committed by a husband or partner according to a major university study turkey has implemented important legislative changes to its penal and civil codes to deal with this crisis including the establishment of a legal framework for the protection of domestic violence survivors giving them the option of requesting a protection order however there are serious shortcomings in the implementation of these reforms the turkish government had helped a few women we interviewed but many others said that police prosecutors and judges sent them back to their abusers or acted so slowly on emergency protection orders that their very purpose was defeated too few domestic violence shelters offer protection and some even keep their doors shut for victims lacking proper documentation or women with disabilities the turkish government which largely has good laws on the books must systematically and actively improve their implementation and guarantee access to protection and justice for women like selvi or zelal who desperately need it how to end this pandemic of violence against women and girls that still affects a quarter of all women in europe the european signatories to the new convention gathered in istanbul can learn from turkeys experience strong legislation is necessary to fight domestic violence but it is not enough every woman who survives violence should have access to protection whatever her ethnic background legal status sexual orientation marital status economic situation or profession the uk should start by signing the council of europe convention not just for women in the uk but to send a clear message to all other countries in the region take the struggle against violence seriously,2011-05,minister country across

rising high from the cultural landscape this week are tributes to two of the most powerful british women artists born in the th century its an accident of the calendar that a m museum dedicated to barbara hepworth is admitting its first visitors in wakefield on saturday so soon after the opening of a major london retrospective of work by tracey emin born but the collision is entirely fitting the two artists have little obviously in common apart from the fact that their work grows precisely from the sites of their childhood hepworths sculptures are rooted in the rock and soil of west yorkshire as immovably as emins videos installations and drawings are from the sands and promenade of margate but the art encouraged by these locales looks very different not least because hepworths work is largely abstract while emins is narrative and figurative the figure in question frequently being her own however what unites hepworth and emin is that both have been at different times the dominant woman artist of their generation an exposed and lonely position that sometimes seems to be subject to different critical rules from those affecting men so the simultaneous opening of the hepworth wakefield and tracey emin love is what you want at the hayward gallery in london usefully raises the question of whether it is sexist or critically sensible to consider work by women as a separate artform hepworth didnt think it should be in common with many female pioneers of her period she was a feminist more by example than manifesto strikingly she always called herself a sculptor in preference to the sculptress favoured by critics and academics of the time although her term can be seen as a political statement rejecting the potentially patronising tone of the lady alternative emin may feel relieved that there is no discriminating noun such as artess yet hepworth would also in interviews use phrases such as a sculptor and his work which suggests something darker an acceptance that she was an exception in the profession and that she must work in a masculine context certainly in remaining torrentially productive as an artist while also having four children she can be seen as a classic instance of the demand on those to whom it falls to be workplace pioneers to work harder than anyone else in this apparent desire to match and merge with the majority membership of her profession hepworth was helped by the fact her pieces were not significantly different from those of say her yorkshire contemporary henry moore cultural conservatives would have disliked them equally for their modernism rather than distinguishing by sex hepworths work contains references that are autobiographical emotionally one madonna and child memorialises a son who died as an raf pilot or anatomically allusions to breasts vaginas and wombs can be read into the curves and hollows of her shapes however the sanitising pixelation of abstraction means that these references never frightened the horses of the male critical or curatorial establishment in contrast emin has taken on the harder task of being a star woman artist whose subject is explicitly womanhood especially in the early part of her career her work was frequently described by male detractors as gynaecological many images literally are but its perhaps revealing that the male nudes of lucian freud for instance are seldom described as urological from the broader media if not the official critical community emin has frequently suffered moralistic judgment of her themes and images and the life that underlies them her advantage was that even as they sometimes mocked her the media wanted emin because she is vividly recognisable and articulately provocative other less photoopportunistic or soundbiting artists bridget riley say or rachel whiteread or sarah lucas would never command equivalent attention although as germaine greer has pointed out the next test is whether emin can retain this visibility as she enters the age range in which women are traditionally painted out of public life lets hope she can because where hepworth seems to have regarded her againstthegrain status as an accidental fact emin has systematically challenged the continuing male bias of the cultural world it may be difficult to build one day an emin margate gallery to match hepworths at wakefield because her stretch of kentish coast has just honoured a local of the past with the turner contemporary but she would merit it and she needs specifically to be called a woman artist because both thematically

has anyone ever heard of trivial and consensual rape no me neither yet the justice minister ken clarke suggests that only some violent rapes are serious and its unwilling women who make them so by using words such as serious and forcible for only some rapes in one tetchy fourminute radio interview the most senior legal politician in the country underlines all that is wrong about rape and the criminal justice system in this country he did it again in another interview on sky when he talked about serious proper rape cases although he has subsequently stated that all rape is a serious crime amid calls for his resignation to understand this just imagine clarke saying similar things about murder or other kinds of assault few politicians or lawyers talk about murder victims asking for it or of assaults that arent violent or indeed serious his comments feed into the belief that women who report rape are lying that reporting a rape is relatively easy and that some rapes arent really rapes at all but i dont know kinky sex so lets start by saying that rape penetration without consent is always serious no matter how much force or violence is used it is a crime and should be treated like one the sex offences review in ruled out separate offences such shewasgoingtoandthenshechangedhermind rape or the shewaswearingashortskirt rape because according to rape crisis who get to deal with the ramifications of this crime more than most of us rape is rape regardless of the relationship or the context clarke who as he told victoria derbyshire on her live show on wednesday has presided over a fair few rape trials in his time should know this the babbling on about underage sex didnt really help using clarkes scenario yearolds are being raped by their notmucholder boyfriends because theyre too young to give their consent were still waiting for the statistics on the number of teenagers who subsequently go to the police to press rape charges if what they are doing is having happy consensual if under the age of consent sex any sympathy with clarkes proposals on reducing sentences for criminals who plead guilty and i have some will be lost in the sense that misconceptions about sexual violence which mostly occurs between two people who know each other is alive and kicking at the heart of government his desire to improve justice by reducing sentences in rape cases is wrongheaded not because it puts costcutting above locking up more criminals and therefore outrages the daily mail but because they do little to help the victims of a system that is itself dysfunctional in the same interview clarke mentioned the ordeal of women who report rape three times saying that encouraging men to plead guilty as early as possible could reduce that ordeal the problem with these proposals is that they allow leniency for the criminals and yes the average sentence for rapists is five years mr clarke so some could be free in under a year while doing nothing to deal with what makes it such an ordeal in the first place an adversarial court system is a hideous place for any traumatised and damaged assault victim is it any wonder when the crossexamining and character assassinations are added to the forensic examinations by doctors and the suspicions that they wanted sex all along that a vast majority of rapes according to the department of health are never reported in the first place the fact that some of reported cases actually result in a conviction on a charge of rape is a disgrace conviction rates once formal charges are brought are higher in but most of these pleaded guilty far fewer are found guilty by a jury again underlining the difficulty of herwordagainsthis trials so guilty pleas do result in convictions but how many women would go through the ordeal only to know that the aggressor could be out in just over a year why should the criminal benefit from the horrors they inflicted once they report the crime whats more in changing the rules like this for rape it is downgrading it as a crime to that of burglary and other crimes against property this isnt justice its further victimisation instead of what could have been a good and useful debate about the criminal justice system and sentencing clarkes comments highlight the fact that rape is regarded as a different kind of crime to other assaults ed miliband was one of many calling for the justice secretarys dismissal today whether he remains in place or not what needs reforming is the attitude to rape that his words convey below the line jane martinson responds to some

on monday satoshi kanazawa an evolutionary psychologist at the london school of economics published an article on his psychology today blog that sent shockwaves across twitter and the blogosphere and reminded many of us of just how dangerous this kind of science can be in his incendiary piece which has since been taken down kanazawa discussed the scientific basis for why black women are less attractive than any other women note that kanazawa did not claim to have discovered why black women are perceived to be less attractive or why he believed that black women are less attractive after bombarding the reader with colourful bar graphs and a set of numbers he asserts that he has found the answer as to why black women are objectively less attractive than women of any other race and it has something to do with testosterone and genetic mutations following the backlash that ensued the headline why are black women less physically attractive than other women was first edited before the article was taken down in its entirety this is interesting because it implies that the editors didnt initially accept that there was anything wrong with the article itself only a headline that needed tweaking however even the poorestperforming psychology undergrad at a university at the bottom of any league table will tell you that the article oozes bad science from the article the entire study appears to be based on the perspectives and opinions of adult respondents kanazawa reports his findings as objective facts that black women are significantly less attractive than women of other races he fails to provide information on the sample size for his research or the social or economic factors including race that would have impacted on his findings so that readers can deduce for themselves as to what extent these findings can be generalised across time and space as some tweeters have noted its a classic trick in which pseudoscientists blind you with multicoloured graphs and three decimal place figures to convince lay readers that their research was thorough and is conclusive i mean who can argue with three decimal places pseudoscience and racism have a long history together many people who read kanazawas article were instantly reminded of nazi claims to aryan superiority in his tome the foundations of the nineteenth century houston stewart chamberlain claimed to have discovered biological evidence for aryan superiority based on his deeply flawed concepts of human speciation this text and others of its ilk were the basis for the attempted extermination of jewish people under the nazi regime but were unfortunately not without precedent before chamberlain there was the likes of georges cuvier and his contemporaries whose treatment of saartjie baartman also known as the hottentot venus early in the th century was premised on the apparent biological inferiority of people of african descent once again proven by bad science could colonialism or slavery ever have been justified without these and other pseudoscientific claims in we have peer review and editors so it is of great concern that psychology today let kanazawas awfully premised poorly presented and racist article even slip through the cracks of course many social scientists were quick to spot the fallacies in his argument but these standards dont exist to protect those who work in the ivory tower they exist to protect the general public that may have nothing more than a passing interest in learning more about the world in which they live kanazawas article insulted and denigrated women of african descent all over the world insinuating that some inevitable genetic development forces them to the lowest rung of his imaginary rigid scale of attractiveness as if a world in which the images of the most beautiful have oscillated between michelangelos creation of eve and imans statuesque frame could ever have a rigid scientific standard for attractiveness for his folly kanazawa has been duly chastised but what about psychology today will they escape censure for letting this offensive tripe go out in the first place recalling that this is the same kanazawa who asserted that he had also discovered whats wrong with muslims in the same rag that published this attractiveness study isnt it about time that someone got hauled over the coals for letting this nonsense go out psychology today has said the article was not specifically commissioned and hasallowed some of its other writers to come out and criticise kanazawa but has stopped short of issuing an apology for its carelessness and will the lse still under the spotlight for the gaddafi fiasco send a clear signal that it will not tolerate its brand being associated with the kind of eugenic discussion that kanazawa seems intent on engendering after all he has been here before in november kanazawa published a paper in the british journal of health psychology alleging that african states were poor and suffered chronic illhealth because their populations were less intelligent than people in richer countries or are we back to allowing science to be used to justify prejudice,2011-05,monday satoshi

politicians came under siege as hundreds of women gathered at parliament to protest at plans to increase the state pension age more quickly the protest organised by charity ageuk coincided with the second reading of the pensions bill which included a revised timetable for changes to the state pension age the bill will bring forward the raising of womens state pension age to by two years from to followed by a further increase to for both men and women by six years earlier than planned by the previous government the women most of whom will be in their s and face working between one and two years more than previously expected want meetings with their constituency mps to express their disapproval rachel reeves shadow minister for pensions and barbara bates a yearold shop worker from durham planned to hand in a petition signed by more than people to downing street women have deluged mps with letters complaining that the revised timetable will not allow them to prepare financially for the changes research by ageuk indicates that mps have good cause to be worried about antagonising potential female voters the number of affected women in their constituencies outstrips their

female constituents who will be affected by the proposed changes spoke against the changes at a debate in westminster hall last week she said historically women have often suffered injustices in the pensions system whenever you have a sharp cutoff date there is an injustice the proposed reforms will mean that women born between and will be caught out however it is not too late to have another look at these reforms to ensure that once again women and this age group in particular do not disproportionally lose out it is not fair to keep moving the goalposts as people get older we know this is not about a large number of people so money could be found by the coalition government we need to know how much it would cost to even out matters this is an opportunity for the coalition to say we really do care about giving equal treatment to the citizens of this country revisions to the timetable will affect nearly million people of which are women who will have to work at least one year more while will have to work two years longer it will cost the worst affected women up to each in lost pension income and will force both men and women to wait longer for vital benefits such as pension credit which are paid in line with the state pension age ros altmann director general of saga says unemployment benefit will not be an option for many of those affected out of work benefits will last only six months and are far less than state pension having a small private pension will exclude many of these women from benefits and many would not want to claim anyway they feel this is an insult

theresa may the home secretary said there were few better investments than investing in women last night at a cheery launch party for un women in the uk women would be at the centre of the coalitions development efforts she said people cheered there was even a song so why wont the government commit any money to it un women has been up and running since january whats more its creation from the remnants of four separate bureaucracies in the un was years in the making and the uk government under a different leadership admittedly was one of its biggest backers the uk is still on the executive committee whats going on now before may who is also lest we forget minister for women and equality and andrew mitchell her colleague over at international development get all huffy they have both repeatedly said that the coalition is simply waiting for a strategic plan from the un body which should be produced in a few weeks some money a paltry million dollars or two has been given for transitional funding for the new un body just to make sure it can continue to function while this plan is drawn up presumably the superman headquarters of un women would be empty right now if all donor nations decided to do this but still dfid in charge of parcelling out the cash emphasised the governments desire to focus on results when asked but which results to pick tackling the vast discrepancies in power wealth and security between the sexes is no small task and where to start must be headacheinducing un women has pinpointed five main priorities but ranging from ending violence to increasing political participation to redressing the wealth gap they are hardly narrow targets on top of that money is girdletight how to explain the funding of agricultural equipment in liberia when sure start centres are nonstarters right now then liam fox went and put the cat among the pigeons by questioning why the uk should even pay as much as of gdp to foreign aid there was much talk of shared visions and support last night but the entire event and lack of announcements about money showed what a difficult task michelle bachelet the indomitable first leader of un women has on her hands given the political situation its easy to understand why theres such an emphasis on the financial as well as social and political gains to be made from funding projects that aim to empower women bachelet the former president of chile currently love bombing london likes to say its not only the right thing to do but the smart thing to do she is a walking almanac of gender statistics for every given to a women in the developing world goes to her family the similar figure for a man is women tend to use money to pay for their childrens education and to buy food she didnt say what the men are spending it on but beer and sports subscription channels do not help end poverty and domestic violence rates seemed to be the gist despite being in a country and among people who had worked tirelessly and often voluntarily to support un women there were obvious political differences between her and may the most senior female member of the coalition government yet there is obviously much common ground in seeing women as a way out of some of the worlds worst health and poverty traps mitchell will share another platform with bachelet in the house of commons later today lets hope the warm words

if this doesnt remind you of medieval times i dont know what could a delhi court while recently sentencing a man for repeatedly raping his minor stepdaughter expressed concern over the growing incidence of rape in india and suggested that it could be curbed by alternative punishments such as chemical or surgical castration besides ringing loudly of the barbaric sentiment of cutting a thiefs hands for stealing this suggestion is also devoid of any analytical or meaningful understanding of rape instead it reeks of a literalism we could all do well without to cap it off it seems to be working on the developed countries have it too premise by suggesting surgical or chemical castration as punishment for sex offenders the court is reducing the crime of rape to a mere physical act of the insertion of penis fingers or other objects into a womans vagina it implies that if a mans testicles are removed surgically or his libido lowered through chemical administration he would not be able to nor would have the desire to rape a woman but the psychology and sociology of rape go much beyond that simplistic assumption rape is not merely a physical activity aimed at deriving pleasure it is in fact about violation of a womans right over her body castration does not take that into account it seems to be working on do you have the balls to do that principle a very teenageish principle indeed furthermore recommending castration as punishment inevitably leads to scientification of rape by scientifying rape in this manner one risks justifying rape if lower sex drive is supposed to ensure lower or no incitement to rape then surely rapists are only medical patients with higherthannormal sex drives for which they find outlet in rape blaming superfluous production of the male hormone for rape almost makes the crime excusable for the rapists cant help themselves despite the sheer foolishness and immaturity of the court and the judge we need to recognise the intention behind it since rape and sex crime has been on the rise in india especially metropolitan cities in recent years a total of cases of rape were reported in delhi the crime capital of india last year and reported cases are only the tip of the iceberg stigmatisation of victims remains a huge deterrent to report rape when courts can indulge in victimblaming to the extent of entertaining a rapists offer to marry the victim and consenting to subject rape victims to the two fingers test to verify rape it does not come as a surprise that most victims would rather not go to court at all the few who do are harassed during the proceedings and often have to wait for more than a decade to get justice see the infamous priyadarshini mattoo case for example it is a slight consolation that women in india have started organising and speaking out against rape and violence against women and yet it seems to be a slowmoving affair the court is right to suggest that more stringent measures need to be put in place to address this issue only they do not have to be barbaric and literal the judiciary suggesting chemicalsurgical treatment should search for answers within its own premises first low

ive been raped but its ok im alive and i didnt think i was going to be these are the first words i remember my wife kate saying to me after she had been raped while we were away in france last august with our two young children it was the first day of the holiday and we decided i would take the kids canoeing while kate had some time to herself when we paddled back to the canoeing centre later that morning one of the instructors was waiting for us at the edge of the water your wifes here he said then in french she has been raped i knew what the word meant but thought it couldnt be right i ran up to the centre and found police cars everywhere kate was in the waiting area trying to hold herself together but clearly in a state there was no time to absorb the shock of what had happened we left the children with another english family while the police drove us off for questioning our route took us past the place where kate had been raped by the bridge over the river we had been canoeing on i felt a lurching sickness when i saw it on our way to the station the police told us that the rapist had been caught the situation seemed clearcut kate had been randomly attacked but the police still asked her how long her dress was and whether it covered her shoulders at the hospital the doctor who examined her and gave her hiv medication seemed disgruntled and impatient nobody except me asked kate if she was ok all along she was treated like a piece of evidence rather than a victim of crime it was pm by the time we got back to the house we put the children to bed then started phoning our families friends and the insurance company to tell them what had happened that night neither of us slept kate was up vomiting and retching and i sat with her for hours over mugs of cocoa hugging her and going over what had happened the rape was unusual in that it was a complete stranger kate had walked into the village to do the shopping and passed a man by the side of the road whod asked her to help him he seemed friendly but when she told him she had to go he had pulled her to the ground held her down by the throat and raped her she said she thought he was going to kill her until eventually he got up and ran off i dont feel anger towards the rapist i pity him we found out later that he was only and id put money on him having been abused as a kid all my anger is reserved for the french police and legal system who failed to treat kate with care in the aftermath of the rape i hoped wed find better support back in the uk but our local rape crisis line is open only a few hours a week and there are no facetoface rape counselling services fortunately we have received an outpouring of kindness from friends and family i cant think of any other crime we could have experienced that would have led to a conversation about whether or not to tell people what had happened we decided to be completely open we both knew we were traumatised and didnt want to pretend otherwise seven months on we remain in a state of shock suffering nightmares tiredness and bouts of depression there has been a violent intrusion into the most private part of our relationship and that is difficult i remember talking to a male friend and he said it makes you feel like a shit doesnt it it does make you much more aware of the power imbalance between the sexes kate still struggles to trust people and she fears she will never feel able to walk in the countryside alone again but we are comparatively lucky kate thought she was being killed she thought her body would be dumped in the river that id be left as a bereaved husband to bring up our children alone and even considered a suspect as well after the attack we stayed on in france for two days and tried to give the children some semblance of a holiday we took them on the vlorail to a bird display and to a theme park its strange but theyre some of the most powerfully happy memories ill ever have vivid recollections of us laughing together as a family kate was physically and emotionally a mess but she was alive it could have been so much worse do you have an experience to share email experiencetheguardiancom,2011-05,ive raped ok im alive

this week comment is free published debates about the slutwalk marches taking place in toronto boston and london gail dines and wendy j murphy argued that reclaiming the word slut would be counterproductive for women while ray filar said the marches signalled a new wave in the feminist movement hundreds of readers posted their thoughts on the threads here is an edited selection of some of the comments our community made emmaobrady i am so shocked at how many people disagree with the slutwalks i feel like everyone is missing the point the walks arent a way of saying i am a woman and i can shag about just like any man and wear whatever provocative clothing i like its a way of saying i can wear what i like and not be judged i will not accept blame for sexual assault and rape for the clothes i wear specifically its about ridding society of the objectification of women tanya im fed up with reading comments making analogies with theft saying that wearing revealingsluttyprovocative etc clothing is akin to walking around with your valuables on display if you walk around with cash expensive gadgets etc on displayeasily accessible it increases your chances of having them stolen if you walk around wearing revealing clothing it does not increase your chances of being raped women are raped wearing all kinds of different outfits some women are raped to punish them for dressing slutty often by partners women are also raped to punish them for being frigid for being gay for not being feminine the list goes on more often than not women are raped by people they know they are raped by people who have chosen to rape them not people who have suddenly been overwhelmed by an uncontrollable sexual urge stargazie the problem is that rape just isnt about being sexually attracted to a woman its about being entitled to women most rape victims know their rapist well just as most abuse victims know their abusers well not wearing a miniskirt wont protect you from rape i dont much care about tut tuting for women wearing miniskirts just as you might for people who flash their valuables in public or leave their back door unlocked but no thief has had their sentence reduced or gained sympathy on that regard and neither should any rapist renireni some people have compared womens bodies to valuable possessions to make the allusion that you shouldnt flaunt what you dont want to be touched its thinking like this that seems to reinforce the notion that womens bodies are public space allyf what seems most likely is that there is actually very little women can do within reason to ensure they are never raped thats a frightening and appalling statement but very probably the truth of the matter the only genuinely credible solution to preventing rapes is for rapists to not rape thats why feminists have always been quite right to argue that the focus of rape prevention campaigns should not be womens behaviour but rapists behaviour lisaansell you know what strikes me in these debates the expectation that women should treat all men as potential rapists and cover themselves as if mild mannered ted from accounts will be turned into a rapist if my skirt is too short what kind of men do you know rape is a serious crime not something that happens accidentally because the sight of a nicely turned ankle was too much to bear it is deeply insulting to men to pretend they are incapable of understanding this as well as dangerous to women sarka women dont need to be very scantily clad at least by ordinary western standards to get harassment and slag abuse the kind of men who bother or threaten lone women and think of them as sluts or call them that when being vicious are not really all that interested in what the woman is wearing they havent got a problem with scantily dressed women but with women full stop the slutwalk was presumably meant ironically though i dont think you can reclaim the word slut because it has never had any positive meanings whether in relation to sex or hygiene and tidiness what you can do however is defang the word by adopting it in a way that shames those who use it in its traditional meaning auntieem sexual predators are bullies and they go for the easy target regardless of what they are wearing i am so sick of being regarded as an uppity feminist whinger because i want to go about my life without the threat of sexual violence hanging over me men get william wallace they get gandhi they get the antiapartheid movement etc etc why is it so hard to understand why women want to be liberated naomimc on the wider point of reclaiming the word slut language is an entirely valid arena for activism and is in no way a waste of precious feminist resources language is dynamic and the use subversion reclaiming and disclaiming of it is hugely important to liberation but i dislike the passive approach to language that some take that there are words that we should cower away from because of their strength saturation and history i have power over language as well and im going to use it dictamus its misogynists who think that women who have sex need to be called a name for it actually the real message should be dont call us anything maybe the proponents of slutwalk think that the antirape message is ready to be heard which is why they are getting so much coverage the truth is that the story is being sold because of pictures of young white women parading through the streets in their underwear waving signs sluts say yes the patriarchy has always offered women the choice between virgin and whore men love us in either category its a shame that the slutwalkers think that their liberation is going to come through the second category slut doesnt need to be reclaimed men need to stop raping

what unites jemima khan and helen wood with slutwalking at first glance the wealthy socialite the former escort and a global protest movement dont have a lot in common yet they are all part of stories that have been both feasted on and fed by social networks and in particular twitter over the last few days with twitter enjoyed by more than m users that could be true of all stories of course but the online frenzy these stories have provoked suggests we are witnessing a new wave of feminist activism as well as a backlash in which new forms of communication take on some very old forms of prejudice so for women at least twitter is both a cause for great celebration and some niggling elements of concern the celebration bit is easy its not just that many of us including me dont seem to be able to live without it it brings people together in a way scarcely imagined just a decade ago so a remark made by a canadian policeman to students at osgoode hall law school ive been told im not supposed to say this women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimised can lead to thousands of people protesting across the world that rape is never ok and that a woman can dress as she likes without asking for it in the uk alone have pledged to attend londons planned slutwalk on june while cities across the country such as edinburgh and cardiff are also planning events the speed with which the protest grew underlines the power of twitter to rally support against injustices attitudes such as blaming rape victims for their attacks help underpin the reason why so few women come forward to report sexual crimes and when they do there are such low conviction rates this question of identity leads us to jemima khan and helen wood the former has almost followers who have read her most recent tweets which deal with erroneous accusations that she has had an affair with jeremy clarkson the latter was an escort or vice girl in our more enlightened papers who is subject to an injunction after sleeping with a famous married actor twitter has given oxygen to woods story in a way that the anonymous actor hoped to avoid by taking legal action in the first place and i along with most journalists can only welcome that what makes me uneasy are the double standards revealed when such stories become exciting gossip so women such as khan get vile hate tweets and woods name is plastered all over the media while the actors identity is still unknown apart from to any journalist or lawyer who wants to know it it seems to me to be an example of double standards as befits this whole sorry tale of superinjunctions such injunctions protect the private lives of the rich and powerful nearly all men while leaving the largely female halves of the relationship exposed dont get me wrong khan wealthy and famous is hardly powerless neither is wood who after all prompted the legal action because she wanted to sell her story to the news of the world but their treatment at the hands of the masses reflected in twitter suggest that double standards over sexual behaviour is alive and well even in a world which allows us to communicate and bring change as never before similar things can be said of all social networks but it seems more surprising of twitter is it just the echo chamber nature of the network that makes it so danny alexander mp called twittersphere a parallel

in the guise of a new feminist craze known as slutwalking riot grrrl attitude is making a comeback for those against slutwalking who see it as nearly as bad as afternoon tea with andy gray wellintentioned maybe but ultimately awful the disagreement lies over whether it is possible or even desirable to reclaim the word slut gail dines and wendy j murphy have quite rightly pointed out that the right to be called slut is not the beall and endall of feminist activism but no one is suggesting it is this move to embrace the word as a term of positive sexuality may currently be travelling across the world to the tune of the marching band but it harks back to the dawn of the s when musician kathleen hanna unwilling figurehead for the riot grrrl movement and lead singer for bikini kill went on stage with the word slut scrawled across her body in doing this she made a visceral powerful statement about her sexuality her message was not yes i am a slut it was this by reclaiming the derogatory terms that you use to silence my sexual expression i dilute your power so far so feminist unfortunately not everybody got the memo predictably this slightly complex message about bolstering womens sexual power through use of misogynist insults was overlooked instead as they became successful riot grrrl bands were commodified commercialised and eventually repackaged girl groups became known mostly as visions of unmitigated unthreatening saccharinity revolution girl style was conflated with girl power real empowerment with relentlessly boring softporn imitation it is awareness of the possibility of something similar that motivates dines murphy and others who oppose slutwalking instead of reclaiming slut those in opposition argue lets continue to campaign for freedom of safe and consensual sexual expression for people of all genders free from gender stereotypes in which the very concept of sex being shameful is left looking as ridiculous as everything nadine dorries says and does its fair criticism on the other hand their contention is that to reclaim the word in some way negates the efforts of those trying to eradicate the attitudes leading to such labels i suspect that despite the tireless ongoing efforts of all kinds of feminists there will always be those who use slut or an equivalent as a sexist putdown those people who reclaim the word as their own however unsuccessfully may be proposing a different kind of solution to that advocated by those who would like to see the word fall from usage altogether but they are not the problem nor frankly could they make the problem any worse than it already is dines and murphy also suppose that the drive to reclaim the word wastes precious feminist resources but the fact is that this kind of

it wasnt long ago that being called a slut meant social death no nice boy would take you home to meet his parents and no good girl would ever be your friend at the same time refusing to submit to sex meant you were a prude or frigid in short there was no right way to be things have improved a bit in that young women are more insistent on their right to sexual autonomy but sexually active women remain vulnerable to harsh social judgments even as the mass media celebrate and encourage such behaviour and research shows that the label slut still has longterm negative consequences especially for younger girls nevertheless a group of activists organised an event called slutwalk that took place on saturday in boston it followed on the heels of a similar event in toronto earlier this month where women rallied in response to a comment made by a representative of the police that women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimised to be sure such a comment from law enforcement is highly offensive in suggesting that some victims of rape are responsible for the criminal acts of their attackers rather than admonishing women to dress a certain way police should be warning potential offenders that they should avoid assaulting women in order not to go to prison the fact that more than turned out to march around boston common suggests that women are indeed hungry for sexual autonomy but something else was at work here many of the banners protested the ubiquity of sexual violence in the lives of women signs made by protesters showed that women are angry with being blamed for male violence and fed up with the failure of the culture to hold men accountable clearly the theme of the slutwalk has struck a nerve with similar events being planned around the world including one in london in june the organisers claim that celebrating the word slut and promoting sluttishness in general will help women achieve full autonomy over their sexuality but the focus on reclaiming the word slut fails to address the real issue the term slut is so deeply rooted in the patriarchal madonnawhore view of womens sexuality that it is beyond redemption the word is so saturated with the ideology that female sexual energy deserves punishment that trying to change its meaning is a waste of precious feminist resources advocates would be better off exposing the myriad ways in which the law and the culture enable myths about all types of women sexually active or chaste alike these myths facilitate sexual violence by undermining womens credibility when they report sex crimes whether we blame victims by calling them sluts who thus asked to be raped or by calling them frigid who thus secretly want to be overpowered the problem is that were blaming them for their own victimisation no matter what they do encouraging women to be even more sluttish will not change this ugly reality as teachers who travel around the country speaking about sexual violence pornography and feminism we hear stories from women students who feel intense pressure to be sexually available on demand these students have grown up in a culture in which hypersexualized images of young women are commonplace and where hardcore porn is the major form of sex education for young men they have been told over and over that in order to be valued in such a culture they must look and act like sluts while not being labeled slut because the label has dire consequences including being blamed for rape depression anxiety eating disorders and selfmutilation women need to find ways to create their own authentic sexuality outside of maledefined terms like slut the recent tubecrush phenomenon where young women take pictures of men they find attractive on the london tube and post them to a website illustrates how easily women copy dominant societal norms of sexual objectification rather than exploring something new and creativeand its telling that while these pictures are themselves innocent and largely free of sexual innuendo one can only imagine the sexually aggressive language that would accompany a site dedicated to secret photos of women while the organisers of the slutwalk might think that proudly calling themselves sluts is a way to empower women they are in fact making life harder for girls who are trying to navigate their way through the tricky terrain of adolescence women need to take to the streets but not for the right to be called slut women should be fighting for liberation from culturally imposed myths about their sexuality that encourage gendered violence our daughters and our sons have the right to live in a world that celebrates equally womens sexual freedom and bodily integrity,2011-05,wasnt long ago called slut meant social death

there are three things that definitely do not exist according to the website advicenoworguk the loch ness monster cats nine lives and common law marriage patricia jones the woman at the centre of last weeks supreme court case to determine what share her former cohabiting partner is entitled to in the family home has learned this the hard way jones and her ex leonard kernott split up in after sharing a home in thundersley essex for eight years jones paid the deposit and mortgage on the bungalow while kernott paid aweek expenses he moved out in paying no maintenance for their two children now both in their s jones continued paying the mortgage and kernott brought his own property in raising the deposit by cashing in a life insurance policy the couple owned and split equally in a county court judge determined that kernott was entitled to of the propertys value estimated then at he appealed last year and was awarded on the grounds that the couple owned equal shares when they separated and neither had done anything to change the situation since jones hopes the supreme court will reverse this decision but elizabeth darlington a barrister based in leeds specialising in cohabitee cases says cases concerning the distribution of cohabitees assets often end with results contrary to common sense or fairness one client a policeman sold his property and put into a new property he bought in joint names with his new partner because the home was in joint names they both got of its value when they split even though she had contributed no equity however it is usually women who lose out says darlington often because ownership of the home is in the mans name she cites a couple who bought a home in the mans name because the woman was still going through a divorce with the intention that the money she got from the divorce would be her contribution instead the money was used to buy other things including a sports car for the male partner and when they split years later he walked away with the entire value of their home it doesnt have to end like this if you take steps to protect yourself early on buying a home get legal advice how you establish ownership can make a big difference if you split up if you own your home as joint tenants you own it jointly and equally if you split up and sell it you will normally get half no matter how much you contributed if one of you dies the other will automatically get the house if you buy as tenants in common you can own uneven shares in the property if one dies his or her share will go to the beneficiary named in the will in all cases if there are children a court can order the transfer of the home to the parent mainly looking after them if part or all of the home is owned by the other it will revert to that partner when the youngest child turns renting a home consider putting both names on the tenancy if only one is named that person can evict the other if you split up if the named person leaves the remaining partner can ask the landlord to put his or her name on the tenancy but he doesnt have to agree draw up a living together agreement this forms a record of what each party is contributing to the household a court can ignore it but will generally uphold it if what you agreed produces a fair outcome neither party was under pressure and you were honest about your finances when drawing it up if you have it drawn up by a solicitor and independently witnessed it will be legally binding make a will without one your property and assets will all go to your blood relations if you die and your partner may not even be able to stay in your home children if you are the father of children born before december and have not married their mother you do not have parental responsibility unless you make an agreement

whats wrong with wanting world peace anyway the organiser of miss universe gb being a powerfully persuasive woman i had to admit its a noble aspiration young girls and their dreams it was a touchy subject this bank holiday which seemed designed to give feminists nightmares it started with one royal fairytale the ordinary girl who became a princess through love it ended with another fantasy being crowned the most beautiful one event received worldwide coverage the other the miss universe great britain competition was largely ignored beauty pageants are deemed cheesy and sexist visions of eric morley with his bad combover announcing the miss world winners in reverse order still haunt tv executives the show hasnt been televised in the uk for years in many countries however national selections for the final competition are hugely popular events its also a multimilliondollar enterprise owned by another combover man donald trump the man who would be us president this year the show was a hotbed of controversy a strange concoction of unlikely bedfellows lined up to criticise shanna bukhari an english literature graduate for daring to enter the contest some muslim men were irked by the idea of her showing off her physical charms some feminists by the notion of a beauty contest and some rightwing elements by an asian woman representing britain i became involved when i got a call from bbc radio s womans hour they sought my views on shannagate i duly gave them and soon i was on my way to be a judge at the pageant i set off ostensibly with an open mind but in truth with all the prejudices many have about such contests intact i felt the need to mock my invitation texting friends en route that if any girl dared tell me she loved animals and wanted world peace i would feel obliged to administer a quick clip round the ear i worried i would be the only woman there with my own hair skin and breasts the reality proved different sure there was more big hair and spray on tan than anyone should have to face but there were genuine surprises too in an interview round which unfortunately is not seen by the public the contestants were bright and articulate several had travelled extensively and taken up hugely adventurous challenges many raised funds for charities and spoke movingly of how personal experiences had led them to support their particular cause all had qualifications and ambitions beyond the beauty field although they were openly determined to win the contest without being defensive they spoke compellingly about why they should not be criticised for competing as i marked the girls on personality i was genuinely flummoxed should i pick the most likeable girl or the one who would best be an ambassador for britain on trips abroad and at official functions even if she seemed a little too polished how often has that been the issue when electing political leaders similar factors came into play when judging the show rounds on paper judging a

six months after its historic launch un women has managed to raise just one fifth of its expected funding target at this rate the toddler will struggle to do any of the things it was set up to do namely coordinate and invest in gender equality and womens empowerment around the world michelle bachelet the first head of un women published a strategic plan ahead of the bodys annual meeting which closes in new york today in an opening address she described the current list of donors many countries have increased their contributions some significantly for which we are very grateful but for others the time is now to walk the talk one country that did an awful lot of talking ahead of the foundation of un women last year and which now seems paralysed into inaction is the uk look at this list of countries that have pledged or actually donated money as of wednesday the top three countries are hardly surprising between them spain norway and canada have pledged half of the m total but by the time we get to the th donor things get a little odd for there is saudi arabia pledging one could argue that this feudal territory which bars women from driving may have money to burn but just a few below is greece that cashstrapped basket case of europe closely followed by ivory coast and the democratic republic of the congo which has pledged nowhere on the entire list of nations is great britain this is not through a lack of interest in the new agency in an article for the guardian to coincide with international womens day in march andrew mitchell the development secretary wrote the uk has also played a leadership role in the establishment of un women the new organisation dedicated to gender equality which we will support once we see a copy of their strategic plan we are deeply committed to help it become a powerful agency this strategic plan has been out all week and a call to dfid yesterday has still not elicited a response by midday admittedly the plan is not going to top the bestseller list any time soon full of un jargon and words such as coordination and modalities it basically consolidates everything bachelet and her new team have been saying since january there are five priorities expanding womens leadership enhancing womens economic empowerment ending violence against women and girls bringing women to the centre of the peace and security agenda focusing national plans and budgets on gender equality and the bottom line is that bachelet and her team need money to get cracking ive written about the uks delays in making a funding commitment before some of you felt that the uk shouldnt be spending too much money on vainglorious overseas aid jamborees but even if the budget target of m is met by this represents just of un funding the uk government itself may be cutting services that help women in this country but its entire aid budget represents less than of gdp bachelet whose speeches often speak to the chilean president she once was rather than the bureaucrat she has become makes the case for her agency thus where we fail to capitalise on the potential and talents of onehalf of the population we also squander the potential to reduce poverty hunger disease environmental degradation and violence six months after its foundation and a week ahead of its first report into the progress of the worlds women isnt it time the uk government started capitalising an hour or so after this blog went up and more than hours after being approached the department for international development responded with andrew mitchell international development secretary saying now that the strategic plan has been received i will consider very carefully how we can support its vital mission and deliver value for money to british taxpayers and those we are trying to help a spokesman gave no date and said the department wanted a clear understanding of what the results are going to be again this strikes me as trying to count your eggs before buying the chicken but still at least mitchell added that un women had tremendous potential to improve the lives of millions of girls and women and that some support in kind technical assistance is

how do you solve a problem like beyonc she is the personification of the equality conundrum on the one hand she was the first woman to headline glastonbury and this is a hugely big deal since without that and a bit of florence and the machine before the overwhelming impression remains that only men truly know how to boogie but what does she do with her new supremacy her crowning achievement for all womankind she sings a song about how if you wanted to go out with her moron you should have pursued that desire with a proposal of marriage put a ring on it she sings waving her hands about like an andrews sister on amphetamines put a ring on it mouth the girls in the audience deadeyed with the madness of crowds as if the past years had never happened as if ones own sexual destiny were a meaningless bauble to be hung off the first john with a bank account who shows an interest its distressing and yet would you prefer it to have been coldplay again the same dilemma plays itself out from the new york times to the imf thats not quite fair in the case of jill abramson that papers first woman editor who has never shown herself to be anything other than a rightthinking feminist christine lagarde on the other hand is very much the beyonc of international finance she is problematic for these reasons first she is not above touting about all the ancient stereotypes of femininity which egregious tropes are what keep women out of high office in the first place she talks about her feminine and understated negotiating style and how helpful it is though frankly her immediate stance on greece belt up and get on with it wont strike protesting greeks as at all understated i shouldnt think lagarde said in an interview that the fragile foundations of the euro were down to its founding fathers founding fathers not mothers notice regrettably there was no woman at the table at the time she is often to be heard bemoaning in a cheerful way the excess of testosterone in the room she lightheartedly told jon stewart on the daily show that men were responsible for the financial crash because of their manly behaviour the delivery and extremity of these statements does cover quite a spectrum sometimes she seems sincere other times shes clearly mainly joking but still i am not a big fan of the subtext a worldview that holds one sex to be inherently more sensible than the other whoevers favour it comes down on no purpose or truth is served by these generalisations oh and then theres her politics a favourite of nicolas sarkozy she is avowedly neoliberal overseeing bn in tax cuts and chipping away at the hour working week the french used to call her the american minister anything that damages social equality generally whether increasing the wealth gap or cutting back on the welfare state or job security will affect women disproportionately this has been shown time and again lagarde may as well be doing beyoncs naked finger dance for all the good she does for womankind prominent women do not necessarily pursue the rights of women generally and it is almost worse when they pretend to lagarde said once i feel accountable to the community of women and i dont want to fail because of them than when they dont compare her with margaret thatcher yet the evidence is that while the highprofile letdowns stick in our minds much important work goes unremarked women in high office politically often form crossparty alliances to tackle specific womens issues that leftwing maledominated regimes have ignored and centreright or even rightwing parties will often adopt traditionally leftist policies which in parliaments without many female representatives people dont even talk about let alone recognise as political currency angela merkel is not a bad example having introduced publicly funded childcare and policies to reduce violence against women the civil architecture of gender equality our equality and human rights commission in europe the european womens lobby in the un the entity for gender equality and the empowerment of women comes from pressure within the ranks of power not from protesting voices of outsiders so even while one might as a voice of protest have much purer political goals and more consistent feminist messages there is also a lot to be said for the more establishment business of muddling towards equality while possibly prioritising other unfeminist aims at the same time moreover it is axiomatic in the equality business that women should have the freedom to be as politically varied as men as idiotic and selfish as men if they must theresa may has to be allowed to happen in order for lisa nandy to flourish rejoicing in female representation only when it chimes with your view is not frankly very feminist even though we are in this ironic situation where a male alleged rapist being a socialist would probably have pursued more femalefriendly policies than a neoliberal woman that does not mean we should regret her ascent to the top job and as for beyonc for gods sake woman if you wanted to get married so much why didnt you ask him,2011-06,solve problem like beyonc personification equality conundrum

thank you for asking me to speak to all of you attending world femininity day wfd i admit to being surprised to be asked since i am a lesbian and a feminist who firmly believes that femininity is nothing but a social construct and that it exists in order that women can be seen as the fairer sex and be judged as less capable and rational than men it may seem odd that i am here at all zoe charles the founder of this radical movement is a femininity and burlesque coach as we now know the definition of feminism has recently broadened somewhat and can now include celebrating the misogynist male invention of slut the practice of women changing their second name to that of their husband to baking cupcakes how things change when i cut my feminist teeth it was clearly understood that the womens liberation movement wlm existed in order to overthrow male supremacy and bring about equality and freedom for women but i am willing to be openminded about wfd let us look at its main purpose and aims to acknowledge and celebrate femininity by women for women for humanity we believe it is vitally important as women to be encouraged to feel powerful through our femininity as opposed to matching or competing with masculine ways of being to achieve power in our lives whether that be socially or in relationships family or career having been a severe critic of slutwalk and being labelled a spoilsport in disliking weddings makeup and high heels i have decided to embrace wfd before you start to heckle let me tell you that i have some experience with things girly when i was i decided to enter my school beauty competition in order to spite my enemy the perfect wendy she won it every year and was ultrafeminine sweet and hardworking i asked the teachers if the participants were only judged on their looks and was assured it was also personality i had plenty of that so entered and to the surprise of many won i wore a tiara at the school fair the following weekend strangely enough the competition was never held again which means i am the reigning miss branksome to this day aged i met feminists and went genderneutral which is how as you can see i present myself to this day but thanks to wfd i am now wondering if i have missed out on something special all these years in i experimented with wearing high heels but due to my lack of perseverance i failed miserably the following year refusing to have the door of femininity closed to me i tried with makeup again a total failure due to the conditioning nay brainwashing at the hands of manhating feminists this past plus years i am at this juncture forced to admit that my sort of feminism has failed after odd years of campaigning to end all forms of violence against women and children the statistics remain grim it is still the case that two women die every week at the hand of a former or current male partner rape is endemic and barely successfully prosecuted and women abused in the sex industry are seen as disposable therefore bearing in mind the wfd commitment to eradicating such abuse we are saying no to the exploitation of women and children this years event is about raising awareness of wfd the event will be raising money for charities committed to ending exploitation of women and children across the world i will roll over and accept that rather than telling men off for abusing women we would be far better off if we deferred to them and made the effort to look pretty demure and soft perhaps then they will be nicer to us so to end thank you for asking me to address you today on this auspicious occasion i will be going from here to a large department store where i will have a complete makeover nails hair makeup and dress i will be taking deportment lessons and my elocution teacher will show me how to speak a little more hesitantly and softly in order that men understand i am not trying to compete with them forget feminism femininity is definitely the way forward,2011-06,thank asking speak attending world femininity day wfd admit surprised asked since lesbian feminist firmly belief femininity nothing social construct exists order woman seen fairer sex

i recognised myself in the photograph of bristol feminists that accompanied deborah orrs article why is feminism still so afraid to focus on its flaws g june but i didnt recognise the picture she painted of feminism worried about branding this was raised in respect of the fawcett societys tshirts that carry the message this is what a feminist looks like as sported by me and a friend in the photo having been on the board of fawcett at the time these were commissioned i can clearly state that the tshirts were a rebuttal of the very idea that feminism should be concerned about branding it was not so much a campaign to reclaim the word feminist as a refusal to bow to pressure to avoid using it pressure arising from the disagreeable proposition that feminism might be a negatively deployable commodity rather than a value system orr believes this anthropomorph feminism is guilty of a fundamentally blunt and somewhat stubborn emphasis on equality and equality here seems to be taken as meaning uniformity which it doesnt is this a suggestion that the enormous and wideranging body of what might be called feminist theory is largely or even typically undernuanced and tends to overemphasise the notion of equality because it just isnt so is the accusation really directed then at people who are in the media spotlight if so since when did the media feminists get to define what feminism is or is the accusation directed at womens organisations i dont know of any feminist organisations which espouse a blunt or stubborn emphasis on equality is the accusation aimed at those who meet in feminist groups presumed to be airily throwing around a bunch of unsophisticated axioms i dont think thats true either i have coordinated a feminist group for years and many times we have revisited these crucial issues about equality and its relation to difference to capitalism to identity to rights and responsibilities sometimes it feels like its all we ever talk about did anyone ever think that female liberation was about ushering women into flashy jobs where is it said that women should not want to prioritise care for others above achievement in the workplace or that paid work is more important than children these tropes are continually used to attack feminists rather than engaging with what feminists are actually doing they are however alien to me as a feminist and as a mother i think they should be alien to fathers and men as carers too there is an important difference between a woman apparently wanting to be the primary carer for a child in competition with other volunteers and wanting to see the care of children and others prioritised and given value feminism is not an entity that is capable of forbidding people to think do or say things nor an entity that can convey fear or be strident or paranoid and its a shame to see it implied that feminism is aligned to closedmindedness when to be a feminist is to be for liberation of body and

laurie penny this is what feminism needs right now being a feminist this summer is pretty exciting its like weve all been at some dull charity drinks reception and someone has hit the lights jacked some power ballads into the speaker system and said ladies lets get messy first there were the slutwalks when all at once as if from nowhere brave angry women all over the world were standing in their scanties in the street screaming about sex and class and patriarchy now theres how to be a woman caitlin morans new tome isnt your classic feminist handbook its as much about taking ecstasy and being a gobby teenage music journalist in the s as it is a total rundown of the existential dilemmas of western womanhood its the gutsy smutty autobiography of a rockstar feminist exquisitely wellwritten stained with fag ash and memories really this book would have been better titled how to be caitlin moran its not the story of everywoman but of one smart successful middleclass british woman who grew up poor and overweight and now gets paid a great deal of money to be knickerwettingly funny about a lot of important things and thats precisely what makes it so brilliant its a powerful and one suspects deliberate riposte to the ghastly ghostwritten memoirs of role models such as katie price who moran describes as vichy france with tits at which point i punched the air alone with the book in my bedroom this book is funny like all the best feminist writing it laughs in the face of power even better its dirty sex oozes out between the pages im talking about real sex not the boring sterile porn producers vision of female sexuality that moran critiques nor the staid carrie bradshaw model whereby one is only allowed to fuck in manolos but real sex all smut and silliness and horny teenage wanking sessions with one eye on an unlockable bathroom door its like my secret garden as written by lady gaga in a skip in wolverhampton with knob gags the filthy glee with which moran describes her mattresscracking desire for her own husband the shuddering frustration with which she declares that she just wants to see somewhere on the internet a video of an actual woman having an actual orgasm is compelling precisely because it is so rare this is what feminism needs right now not another boring list of timid complaints nor a pinkly patronising explanation of why you dont have to stop shaving your legs just because you believe in equal pay but a bit of filth a bit of hope and a lusty bucketful of courage this book is not a revolution or a call to arms its a paperback but its a damn good start selma james moran doesnt want to change much the book intrigues potential readers with its description as a rewrite of the female eunuch from a bar stool but this sets a standard that cant easily be reached even in comedy germaine greer gave us a major compilation of outrageous words and acts suffered by women some of morans best prose describes how terrific it was to read this book the female fruit of the s heralding the birth of an autonomous womens movement for liberation but in the st century when all women have been touched by that movement feminists such as moran seem to be isolated in their western sector not in any way connected with the rest of us having arrived in a mans world they discover they have not shaken the problems of being a woman even famous and powerful women are constantly pilloried for being too fat or too thin or badly dressed and worse in fact moran is speaking to a widely expressed dissatisfaction among women who have found with consternation and sometimes fury that even at the top they are not free of sexism their problem is they live in the same world as the rest of us where for example there is little progress in pay inequity where of reported rapes end in a conviction on the charge of rape and between and are still unreported and where the only move to equity with men is a rise in the proportion of women prisoners and in the pension age some women with social power complain about these injustices especially if directly affected by them but most have not considered that they have to do anything for other women to save their own position in society let alone their feminist souls it is just not possible for any women to be making their own fate as moran claims while the rest of us are condemned to a neverending day of waged and unwaged slavery moran says feminism is the belief that women should be as free as men but greer knew that the first significant discovery we shall make as we racket along our female road to freedom is that men are not free greer concludes with a call for revolution and for women to withdraw our labour moran doesnt want to change much she doesnt seem to know that no one will be free until all of us are the closest we can get to freedom is fighting for it with whomever is as eager as we are to achieve it which feminists are with us zohra moosa in her hands pop culture becomes a manageable beast deliberately irreverent to the point of distasteful absurdity at times likening toosmall pants to the partition of india and pakistan for example how to be a woman is still a read worth making why because it bridges the strident and the practical by being really very funny unapologetically feminist moran makes short work of women who struggle to lay claim to the label it is a benefit of feminism that women can publicly debate the benefits of feminism i cant relate to all of morans experiences having not grown up very poor on a council estate in england for starters but i found myself sympathetic to her views she suggests asking are the boys doing it as the basis of a misogyny meter fit for the much murkier waters of stealth sexism that now surround us at a time when it can sometimes take us a minute to realise that was sexist reminding ourselves how differently men would fare in the exact same situation does help focus the mind but the book wasnt one big yes for me one weak point was suggesting that manners are a feminists best shield in an attempt to be practical and accessible i presume moran partly paints feminisms big aspiration as wanting everyone to be polite to each other obviously i understand that couching a request for basic respect in a cloak of civility can be politic but very little attention is paid to how we move from etiquette to tackling the ongoing gender pay gap womens underrepresentation in politics unequal divisions of domestic labour and violence against women and girls though these links arent very clearly made the book does offer a workable answer to one niggling question why havent women got on better since they got the vote and this is where the book sings for me in morans hands pop culture becomes a manageable beast whose trends women can embrace or reject with clear eyes not quite as deeply insightful as greers female eunuch was for its time how to be a woman does convincingly poke fun at the myriad methods of patriarchy and cheerfully explain why moran is not so secretly up for a feminist revolution where women finally have a go at running things bella mackie force it into the hand of every teenage girl caitlin moran begins by referencing the diary she wrote as a yearold by the end of the first chapter i realised that at i had come to this book years too late this is precisely the kind of book that should be forced into the hand of every girl on the brink of angstridden adolescence by parents who know what horrors are coming notwithstanding the title moran is not inventing a new or achingly pretentious theory on feminism and she isnt passing down edicts or dictating that there is merely one way to be a woman she is above everything trying to set out and dispel the misguided worries women grow up with most importantly she does this with easy humour everything from weight to sexual exploration is covered subjects she sets out using bluntly honest personal experiences that made me nod along with worrying frequency her internal monologue as a teenager sounds uncannily like mine back then and the worrying revelation here is that even at my age this surprised and heartened me girls dont discuss this stuff they keep their heads down and try to blend in with their peers in this world feminism isnt a concept uttered much schools often present feminism as a hazy historical concept revolving around women jumping in front of horses and generally outraging the sensibilities of upperclass gentlemen moran argues persuasively that feminism is still needed with this most pared down reason to join the sisterhood do you have a vagina and do you want to be in charge of it answering yes doesnt mean burning your bra as moran says we love our bras it means wanting to be as free as men are it also disregards the accusation that feminism means hating men if theres one thing this book shows its that the negative connotations attached to feminism are by no means applicable when you use morans reasons to be one perhaps it would be cheating to hand this book to a teenage girl and allow her to bypass all the misery to come sadly you probably have to learn to do this yourself if only for the smug moment when you realise you dont care what some magazine says about celeb diets or your thighs but buy it for your teenager anyway if shes anywhere near as smart as moran shell thank you

there was a great feeling that the london slutwalk represented all kinds of women not because we were all welcome but because we did not really differ in what we wanted we eagerly absorbed and condemned news of each individual crime of discrimination and violence against any woman but we didnt think this made us superior the arrogant bearers of the only real truth the largely white crowd welcomed women of colour not because it was right and moral and good to be against racism but because it was too late in the day for racism antiracism was what we assumed i had never seen and heard this kind of confident impatience with injustice in a crowds reaction women of colour said they were comfortable there and a few young black women moved right to the front to help carry the lead banner happy to identify themselves as leading sluts thats the end of identifying black women as sex objects personified sluts of colour strike back in the same way the crowd identified with sex workers there was such empathy when two women from the english collective of prostitutes spoke that my first thought was that this was a sex worker audience but i then realised that the line between women who turn tricks and women who dont was almost invisible because for them it was not a moral divide but one of chance and choice besides one reason we were marching was because it wasnt anyones business what any of us did with our bodies that included transgender lesbian straight and bisexual women we were not merely marching together we were one claiming not equality but mutual respect for individuality establishing your right establishes and safeguards mine perhaps most expressive of how widely this view was held and the confidence with which women held it was the way men were welcome on the march some were sex workers some were antiwar protestors some had started life as women others were supporting their partners mothers or daughters there was no sense that this was a problem or that women were in any way undermined or nervous because of their presence who is with us is us in this sense the slutwalk was light years ahead of the womens liberation march which made way for it i was at both most of the women years ago were a bit older and less grassroots than the slutwalkers taking themselves more seriously more aware of their talents and skills on their way to higher things many who marched then are by now retired from professorships at universities journalism company managing what were once nontraditional professional jobs for women there were no wheelchair users in but last weekend women with disabilities were an integral part of the protest marching and speaking for sex and against rape once upon a time the head of a europeanwide multinational told a company wife that money was sexy he didnt only mean he could buy sex but that with his money women would find him attractive and he wouldnt have to pay that was a long time ago now women identify with both sex workers and chamber maids we can all say yes or no indeed there were a number of we are all chambermaids placards referring to the alleged attempted rape by the head of the imf women on the march knew that to change anything we needed each other the three who organised the day elizabeth head caitlin haywardtapp and anastasia richardson made that clear when they spoke in the square sex assault wont be eradicated until asylum seekers can report crimes to the police without fear of deportation until sex workers can report crimes to the police without fear of being criminalised until mothers can report crimes to the police without fear of their children being taken from them by social services until transgender women can report rape without their status as real women somehow being called into question and until black women can report rape without being disbelieved because of the colour of their skin the mainly very young women went wild with delight they hate rape and all who protect the rapist from police to the media they hate the cuts and how women are going to be pummelled and they hate being defined and divided by the powers that be this was the new womens movement born of student protests and arab revolutions tearing up the past before our very eyes it has a lot of work to do and it is not afraid by the way my placard read pensioner slut and it got many thumbs up slut

this week im doing a slutwalk in reverse i shall be in las vegas where of women will be clad in hotpants bras and towering stilettoes while i march between them in a modest kneelength dress with warm jacket to protect against the air conditioning yes sisters i shall fight convention and brave the disapproving looks of passersby to hammer home our right to dress like s housewives i reject societys assumptions i refuse to be judged i wont allow men to draw sexual conclusions from my attire dressing like your aunt dahlia does not mean i am prim censorious and frigid that is simply a coincidence actually thats not how it works in vegas its a party town bumskimming skirts plunging tops and vertiginous heels are standard uniform for every female holidaymaker and some of the men the clothes spell wheeee im here for cocktails and dancing when i sit at the bar in my oldfashioned fitted dresses all demure and mostly covered everyone assumes im a hooker theres something rum about this slutwalk business in which women march scantily clad across major cities it started when a canadian policeman told a group of students that dressing like sluts might put them in danger of assault many weak thinkers still subscribe to this faulty logic what a waste of mental resources rape is the violent act of a sociopath you could go mad trying to work out whether your skirt hat wonky tooth or similarity to his mother might trigger it discussing victims clothing is a stupid illogical irrelevance but im not sure that protesting against that isnt an illogical irrelevance as well qed its not rapists who think skimpy outfits are a contributory factor its just lazyminded cultural observers tutters behind net curtains knitters at the guillotine theyre annoying but theyre not dangerous they become dangerous if they act as jurors and allow this logic to colour their verdict but that isnt the reason rape convictions are so pitifully low ive been a juror they never want to convict anyone of anything theyre so terrified of reasonable doubt that they switch off common sense i sat on one case where ill change the details but it was the equivalent of a man buying a gun and my fellow jurors saying but how can we be certain he wasnt acquiring it as a makeshift spoon to stir a soup anythings possible wed better acquit god help the prosecutor trying to get a conviction based on one word against another my fellow jurors could have watched a video of fred west raping a nun and theyd have said can we be sure he wasnt just trying to brush crumbs out of her habit thats why ken clarke is right to want slashed sentencing for early pleas of guilt and such a shame the argument disappeared in the row over his sloppy language rape victims want and need to have their truth recognised and to see their attackers branded guilty far better to achieve that at the expense of longer jail terms than watch so many rapists wriggling free with victims feeling disbelieved and twice damaged id like to see women campaigning in our millions for that real practical legal change to help other women and identify serious villains slutwalks are firing at the wrong target baring arms against an irrelevant enemy but i dont know that slutwalkers are still campaigning about rape anyway its become very confused many say they are protesting simply at normal nonviolent mens interpretation of skimpy clothes as flirtatious or provocative oh give the boys a break what do you want to retrain mens biology so thighs and cleavage no longer strike them as sexual its unachievable which is lucky because i dont want to live in a clockwork orange heterosexual men enjoy looking at scantily clad women specifically because its a bit sexy you cant argue that rape and clothing are unconnected without accepting that this instinct is therefore harmless and victimfree let them look and smile bless em which brings me to the new playboy club in london actually no what brings me to the new playboy club in london is that it has hour blackjack and a lovely smoking terrace its not a strip joint its a swish casino and nightclub where the waitresses and croupiers are dressed as bunny girls theyre cute theyre sexy and let me tell you their bodies are amazing none of your pinched size zero here its all zaftig shapes and blooming health rude health you might say there have been noisy protests around it and many of the protesters were also slutwalkers their logic is about as watertight as that of the canadian policeman i am a feminist i think feminism is about free choice independence and solidarity of course i believe that women should wear whatever they like and i say that only a hypocrite would march in hotpants one day and rail against croupiers in rabbit tails the next mostly i am sad that feminism is suddenly all about clothing maybe thats the answer to what i find rum what makes me suspicious it feels like just another way to chat about fashion the only piece of clothing which is relevant for modern feminists to debate the only one with a complex argument counterargument and serious social implications either way is the burqa shorts bras bunny ears meh leave that to sex and the city none of it matters none of it means anything for me the best feminist statement of last week came from a man hes called ian wheeler and his wife is a patient at lister hospital in stevenage which has just been issued with a sixpage set of clothing guidelines for nurses by its nhs trust it doesnt matter what they wear said mr wheeler as long they do their job

leaving home to go to university is an exciting time often the taste of freedom can be intoxicating it can also be one of the most dangerous times in a womans life young women are particularly vulnerable to sexual assault studies have found that females aged are at high risk of sexual violence and harassment however policy on violence against women during this and the previous administration has made no specific reference to students in a nationwide survey on female students experience of violence conducted by the national union of students nus found that one in four respondents had experienced unwanted sexual behaviour hidden marks the first study of its kind also found that one in seven women students had experienced a serious physical or sexual assault while at university or college and over two thirds had experienced some kind of verbal or nonverbal harassment this included groping flashing and unwanted sexual comments as one respondent said almost every time me and my friends go out to a club you can guarantee that one of us will have some kind of violence or unwanted attention forced on us by drunk men unsurprisingly alcohol features in the majority of the assaults and many instances of harassment but we should be clear that whether the perpetrator victim or as in most cases both are drunk it is not the bottle of booze that commits the crime in the study women who had been drinking were far more reluctant to report than others for fear of not being believed i can understand why i recall the case in of a student who said she had been raped by a university security guard who was escorting her back to her halls of residence because she was too drunk to make the journey alone the judge ordered his acquittal saying that drunken consent is still consent we should learn from the way in which student sexual assault has been dealt with across the pond uk academics alison phipps and geraldine smith in a forthcoming paper highlight several reasons why campus sexual assault gets far more attention in the us than it does here first womens studies courses that can lead women into engagement with feminist activism are widespread whereas in europe such courses are on the decline second there exists good solid data on the prevalence of sexual assaults on us campuses and journalists give the topic decent coverage finally there is far more emphasis placed on the responsibility of the universities themselves to prevent such crimes the turning point in the us was a notorious and tragic case in in which a female student was raped and murdered by a male fellow student the late jeanne clerys parents founded security on campus inc which embarked on a sustained programme of lobbying the federal government that led to the clery act this act among other things requires that institutions collect statistics on campus crime and take steps to address and prevent it let us hope the uk does not have to face such a tragedy before universities take serious action there are a number of simple things they could do immediately to make their female students safer most obviously they need to have crossinstitutional policies to tackle violence against women students readers may be surprised to know that they dont already campuses could also be made much safer by proper lighting and security in student residences with bus routes can take female students as close as they can to their door campus security who are often first on the scene when a student is attacked need to be properly trained too often these incidents are hushed up or wellmeaning but ignorant things are said there needs to be better referral routes from university counselling to rape crisis centres sexual assault referral centres and other services and support needs to be publicised particularly to international students who may be unfamiliar with available sources of help there needs to be liaison with local police forces although this needs to be handled sensitively rather than pressuring victims to report and crucially there need to be routes for female students who experience violence to report this to the institution and for this to be logged my friend alice vachss a former sex crimes prosecutor who has done exemplary work in the us on campus sexual assault response says that if she could change only one thing it would be to increase the consequences for friends and allies of the sexual aggressor who harass taunt and threaten women trying to come forward with a complaint despite all the beautiful work thats been done here in the states our campuses are still so rape tolerant that the most likely outcome for a campus sex crime victim is that she leaves school campuses may be the last true remaining communities sure we need improved policies but most fundamentally we need policy enforcement that changes that community culture cultural change is difficult to achieve but if institutions are prepared to work with students unions police and local womens services it may be possible to chip away at the culture in which sexual harassment is sadly part of a normal friday night out,2011-06,leaving home go university

what exasperates feminists no its not men its women who cant choke out the fword in reference to themselves even though they have reaped so many rewards from the achievements of the movement and would be horrified to find themselves living in a culture that had never benefited from feminisms influence a new report launching the website trustlaw women and highlighting the continuing degradation and abuse of millions of women worldwide offers a sobering reminder of how vital feminism remains but as hope rises in the feminist breast that a new generation of british women will be less chary of the label its probably worth asking exactly why such stubborn reluctance has been so widespread the lazy answer is that feminists have a lingering bad image as manhating crophaired harridans in illfitting dungarees a tshirt campaign launched a couple of years back by the womens lobbying group the fawcett society urged people to display the slogan this is what a feminist looks like the campaigns very existence confirmed that feminism is still worried about branding but its a lot more complex than that the very fact that some feminists are so willing to accept that women dont want the label for such superficial reasons rather than crediting women with more profound intellectual discomfort is an indication that even feminist attitudes can sometimes be dismissive of women and their legitimate concerns feminists and im generalising here tend towards the conclusion that women who dont sign up are simply hostages to the tyranny of the patriarchy whose feeble personal consciousnesses have refused to be raised but there is a lot more to it than that feminism has its own troubling flaws and they are too little addressed the fundamental and rather serious problem is the blunt and somewhat stubborn emphasis on equality difficult enough in a society deeply divided by economic inequality generally even without the added complication that its the people with care of children whatever their sex whose economic freedom is most compromised the world over feminism has not left behind only the crophaired harridan image it has also embraced then dumped the idea of women who have it all the archetypal feminist of the s and s had a fulfilling and dynamic career wonderful children a lovely home and fabulous grooming consensus on the impossibility of such a lifestyle for any but the wealthiest has been longsince reached but the recession and its subsequent deficit have shown all too starkly that even the seeming achievement of more modest autonomy for women is heavily subsidised by the state the stock response is that the state has and should have a duty to support parents and their children and thats true up to a point but it is hard to foster dependence without fostering vulnerability as well feminism in truth is entirely concerned with limiting female vulnerability real as well as perceived but its rhetoric can seem instead to be all about asserting and celebrating female strength sometimes that stops people from seeing whats going on under their noses the mass entry of women into the workplace in the latter half of the last century was claimed too unequivocally as a purely feminist achievement yet the door opened so easily when pushed because the needs of capitalism had undone the bolt everyone knows the empire windrush didnt dock at tilbury in to promote multiculturalism it arrived to provide cheap labour in the employment marketplace as women did too likewise the fastburgeoning demand for professionals did as much to usher women into flashy jobs as female liberation did the exigencies of economic growth left little room for the wilful oppression of people with powerful intellectual potential on the grounds of their sex which is not to belittle the absolutely vital contribution that feminism also made but equal opportunity in the workplace has not resulted in equal achievement and not all of this is the fault of continuing chauvinism women bear the children and far more often than not they wish to be the primary carer for those children at its most strident feminism can be mistaken for an ideology designed to make women feel they are wrong to want that worse feminism has accidentally promoted the idea that its pretty easy to work and have children with the right support in place on even an average income its never easy even once children are at secondary school though its certainly easier then your priorities change work is no longer the most important thing for a while anyway ambition can dissipate for many women thats a selfevident truth but feminism forbids women from admitting too many selfevident truths for fear that the utterance of them will encourage discrimination feminism is paranoid about its mostfeared enemy the wedge with its bayonetthin edge this can be best seen in the abortion debate prochoice minds have to be closed to the idea that science can alter the age of foetal viability because such acknowledgement even in theory might offer succour to prolifers feminism is or can be so paranoid that it cannot acknowledge that there is a difficulty with being less than forthright about the genuine and intractable dichotomies in the lives of many woman this itself perpetuates the most damaging wedge of all between those willing to sign up for feminism and those who have their reasonable

straight men have long had a fascination with lesbianism tap the word into google and you can see the range of porn available from naughty girls sharing their huge toy to vicky and nea need no men i have lost count of the number of times men have asked me what i do in bed they cant imagine sex without a penis being around somewhere which is presumably why so many lesbianfanciers offer to help out in the bedroom once on my way home from a party with a girlfriend i was asked by a passing motorist if we would consider putting on a sex show for him in the back of his car while he watched our state of inebriation was such that all he would have got for his money was a bit of snoring possibly interrupted by puking so we declined out of courtesy male fascination with things sapphic is usually born out of total indignation that we do not desire the male form they are genuinely shocked that women can have fun together when we as one charmer once said to me have no genitals i still laugh at the memory of a lesbian comedian saying during a gig its not that we dislike penises we just dont like them on men i have been told that i am a lesbian because i have yet to find the right man if finding the right man was a prerequisite of heterosexuality we would soon be extinct but things seem to have got out of control lately with mens obsession with lezzerism first the blog supposedly written by a lesbian from damascus was found to have been written by a man living in scotland and then it turns out that paula brooks the editor of the lesbian news website lezgetreal is a retired ohio military man and construction worker what is going on do we not have enough lesbian writers without having to make them up do i need to churn out more diatribes being an out and proud lesbian with a public

pricetype with extra large boobs threefootlong tongue and additional fingers one accused me on his blog of lezzering on again after hearing me on radio i was surprised because the item he was referring to was about the cost of car insurance for women another guardian writer cath elliott is often assumed to be a lesbian by men who take offence at her dislike of rapists and sex murderers she

women who suffer from domestic violence will be trapped in abusive relationships if the government goes ahead with a controversial reform of the welfare system according to leading charities womens aid family action and platform have written to the home secretary theresa may about the governments plans to abolish the social fund cash made available at benefits offices for those in direst need they are calling for a rethink of the reform claiming that the current arrangement is crucial in allowing women who flee violent relationships to resettle under the welfare reform bill to be debated in parliament this week local authorities will be given responsibility for looking after women in crisis but will not have to offer financial assistance the charities who all work with victims of domestic violence fear the change could condemn women and children to unnecessary misery by dissuading them from escaping their abusers it is understood that in their letter to may who is also the womens minister the charities express fears that some councils will not be financially able or willing to help women to escape violent partners they claim there could be a postcode lottery of provision which does not reflect the governments previous claim that tackling domestic violence is a priority and councils could impose a local connection test which could disadvantage women fleeing domestic violence who are often forced to move into other local authority areas many women fleeing the home have to leave everything behind including household furnishings and essential items such as cookers which most families take for granted to rebuild their lives and settle in a new home their children are consequently exposed to deprivation and poverty natalie hoadley a mother of one from croydon south london who left her abusive partner in said that she had only been able to escape thanks to a grant which allowed her to rebuild her life i had no one to turn to and was desperate to get out she said the grant allowed me to buy the essentials once i made the decision to get out i think i would have gone back to him if that money had not been there for me he abused me mentally and punched me when i was pregnant i needed to get away platform s chief executive penny newman said the home secretary must intervene in these proposals to ensure that women fleeing domestic violence are not left without access to essential funds family action chief executive helen dent added theresa may should stand up for women who are fighting domestic violence womens aid chief executive nicola harwin added the social fund is a vital resource for victims attempting to rebuild their lives after domestic abuse and if it is not available victims may be forced to return to their abusers sandra

back home in a small conservative town in india it would be considered perfectly acceptable to evetease me if i went out in western attire aka fitted jeans and tshirt in the capital city of the uk things are surprisingly not very different i run the risk of being called a slut if i dare to go out alone in the night wearing a short dress the two scenes might not be exactly the same but theres a common thread running through them you are a slut provoking sexual attention if you dont conform to male definitions of modesty and that is exactly what slutwalk is protesting against feminists have however been divided on the protests which have already been held across the uk in canada and in the us the main issues that have arisen in the debate is slutwalks use of and attempt to redefine the word slut and its alleged white supremacist and classist nature which fails to be representative either of women of colour or of real sluts or sex workers if calling a movement slutwalk makes it go viral and garners global attention for it i would say this is the way to go not only is the title slutwalk creative and energetic it is also just the right response to the toronto policeman whose remarks led to it in the first place as for redefining the word thats a more controversial issue as it involves the complexities of linguistics there is firstly the difference in the language of the slutshaming discourse all around the world so a boy might yell hot or sexy at me to humiliate me when i go out in western clothes in my home town words that could be considered quite appealing in britain close to this is the problematic exclusivist use of the word slut for white girls white girls with normal sexualities can be abused by being called sluts while such terminology would not be used to shame black women considered to be deviant and hypersexual for me however slutwalk is a movement aimed against the discourse rather than the literal language of slutshaming discourse that categorises and attempts to cage in women discourse that manifests itself in myriad forms including the varying use of words like sexy hot bitch slut etc slutwalk can be blamed for being white supremacist but the only way it would become representative is if women of colour decide to interpret it through their own experiences and narratives and join in the movement slutwalk is therefore for me not about the difference between real sluts and pretend sluts as all women have been and are under slut scrutiny in most of the public spaces all the time those coming out clean from slut scrutiny have been rewarded with husbands and families and those judged to be tainted have been punished in varying degrees through rape sexual assault street sexual harassment and other penalties slutwalk is a protest against the reward and punishment model which demands that all women be good girls who dont go out late in the night who dont expose more than men want them to and who dont protest when they are punished for being bad girls while i may not agree with every other womans understanding of slutwalks but ill still be marching in solidarity this saturday in london why because i am a woman and i

everyone has been debating whether anthony weiner is a pervert who needs to resign or more generously a sick person in need of psychiatric treatment though not as objectionable as the stock christian conservative caught making samesex love weiner surprises but whats really intriguing is that we single people out one at a time for censure in a society full of people engaged in perverted liaisons real or imagined with strangers they met on the internet as glenn greenwald puts it huge numbers of people prance around flamboyantly condemning behaviour in which they themselves routinely engage we only talk about internet sex when someone famous gets caught doing it even though for example an estimated of people view porn online that is in part because only of americans think porn is morally acceptable according to a recent gallup poll the death penalty is more than two times as popular which beats out even premarital sex by five points a full of men view porn at work though im guessing this has to be top brass senior enough to have a door on their office such behaviour is just a huge percentage of what anyone is doing online at any given moment and where do you think your partners computer virus came from a pornographic website is five times more likely to contain malware than a nonporn site the movement of furtive hands has long been an open secret hypocritically condemned and denied when accidentally brought to light as dramatised in the hbo series mad men when betty draper divorced wife of the prolifically adulterous don berates her pubescent daughter sally for masturbating at a friends sleepover our secret desires have now been placed wholesale on the internet where they are plain for everyone to see yet since we hope that our personal dalliances stay private we soldier on with our hardened victorian morality play even as the force of sexuality in our society becomes ever harder to deny and all the more impossible for any one person to control we treat the internet like the locked hotel room of years past but the door has long since cracked open cell phones and the internet provide our libidos with this previously unimaginable extension light years from the numbers of decades past and we dont really comprehend how our private lusting can be so public when virtual how that quiet and lonely moment can go viral alec baldwin writes on huffingtonpost that weiner is a very busy man who needs something to take the edge off in todays world that something is often internet sex weiner is and thus grew up without the internet so the most i can say is that maybe he should possess a little more perspective on this still novel technological gambit todays young people however have only known a life suffused with instant messaging and texting sexting even the innocent flirtations and fondlings of a s or s teen if fraught with sexual health anxiety are for todays youth writ large and in digital circulation according to that gallup poll people are way more accepting of porn and premarital sex but its the sextmessaging under crowd that is pioneering the dickpic revolution that swept representative weiner off his political feet though the real prevalence of sexting is hard to pin down coquetry now often comprises a pantsdown or shirtup photo sent through a phone face included for the truly unfortunate and shortsighted the teen sext epidemic has of course provoked a grownup freakout reminiscent of the scene from john waters film desperate living where a hysterical mother discovers a group of small children playing doctor and flees from the room screaming oh god the children are having sex sexting is a problem immediately and permanently depriving a teen of control over an image of his or her naked body but authorities conflate the problem with the most conventional sexual paranoia nationwide prosecutors have sought to prosecute sexting teens as child pornographers often of themselves criminal and victim

in historical conflicts rape was considered to be one of the spoils of war victorious fighters saw rape of the women wives daughters sisters and mothers of those they had defeated as an entitlement they had earned it and it was an effective way to begin the subjection of the defeated peoples now we learn that the prosecutor of the international criminal court icc may add rape to the war crimes charges against muammar gaddafi on the back of mounting evidence that sexual attacks on women are being used as a weapon in the libyan conflict its about time in the th century the nature of war and the rules of warfare began to change and be codified the media played a role in raising awareness of the horrific and grotesque nature of war and what it had become newspaper front pages and television news allowed the innocent victims of warfare civilians and noncombatants to be seen and heard as never before something had to change the public no longer had the stomach for this if they ever had had after the second world war the idea of a court that could try war crimes and crimes against humanity began to be discussed in the late s after the fall of the soviet union and the end of the cold war the idea was seriously addressed the result was the icc statute which was passed with overwhelming support in rome in july civil society came together as the coalition for an international criminal court to lobby and work with delegates to ensure that a wide range of activities many once seen as spoils of war were included as war crimes and crimes against humanity women came together working as the womens caucus for gender justice to make sure that womens bodies would no longer be an acceptable battleground a wide range of genderbased crimes were included in article crimes against humanity and in article war crimes of the rome statute the icc treaty called for a separate document to further define the elements of the crimes included in the statute and once again civil society was there crimes and particularly the genderbased crimes were defined in the elements to leave little ambiguity or wiggle room for potential perpetrators of this crime to be prosecuted the most serious of the gender crimes included in the icc is the crime of rape but it is not the only one that can be prosecuted the elements leave no doubt about what is meant by rape there was no place left for ambiguity about what constituted consent we worked hard to ensure the elements of the gender crimes were as strong as they could be we cheered our bodies would no longer become the battleground on which men could fight each other right we have seen conflict after conflict discussed on these pages in television the internet and all kinds of new media that were unknown until recently rape is front and centre of the horrific stories we read and see the icc now has a number of situations it is investigating and prosecuting rape and other gender crimes while we know they occur have not featured widely in the charges so far those in front of the court try to hide behind the contention that they themselves never raped anyone and they of course did not order or condone such acts the prosecution wriggles and says that the evidence is not there or is too hard to find or witnesses will not come forward or or or as reasons these crimes are not being prosecuted we read that colonel gaddafi of libya may have been supplying his troops with viagra and other such drugs and may have been encouraging possible exhorting his men to rape the women of the rebels and fight their battle in the timehonoured way on and with the bodies of women we say no enough if there is sufficient evidence available to write and broadcast such stories then surely there must be sufficient

buildings are safe its staff funding and opening hours that are at risk we know that there have to be savings but we believe that this level of cuts is disproportionate to other savings being made by local authorities libraries at risk are often in communities with the fewest nearby public facilities as local libraries close many more people will have to make long and inconvenient journeys or will stop using the library altogether before the agm librarians had been speaking to local wi branches around the country urging them to support the campaign to persuade the government that libraries are

until this governments formation just over a year ago every generation of women has enjoyed greater opportunity my greatgrandmother was a cockle picker on the south coast of wales my grandmother worked in shoe factories and my mother is a primary school teacher but this expectation that women of the next generation will do better than the one before is now fundamentally threatened mps from all sides of the house are today debating what is shaping up to be the biggest assault on women and families for many years one which risks turning back the clock on womens equality this is happening not least in the job markets where the latest figures show that women are now claiming jobseekers allowance this is the highest number since and the outlook is bleak the office of budget responsibility is predicting public sector job losses between and and with women accounting for of public sector employment it is clear that the impact on women looks set to worsen while unemployment is devastating for anyone regardless of their gender access to the labour market has been the single greatest factor in securing economic autonomy for women and has been instrumental in reducing economic inequality between women and men any significant reduction in the numbers of women in employment threatens to undermine progress in reducing this gap which while narrowing still persists beyond the labour market women are also being hit hardest by changes to taxes and benefits analyses commissioned from the house of commons library by yvette cooper the shadow home secretary show that women are hit by around twice as much as men due to the combined tax benefit and tax credit changes on average women are losing around per week compared with for men and when it comes to services the cuts to social care and real terms cuts to sure start which has seen a reduction in its budget means women are under attack from all angles a recent analysis by the womens budget group suggest that the biggest losers from the governments cuts in public services are lone parents and single pensioners the majority of whom are womenin my role as shadow pensions minister i have been fighting hard for one group of women who under government proposals for changing the timetable for the state pension age look set to be hit deeply and unfairly by the government simply because they are unlucky enough to be aged or under the existing timetable for increasing the state pension age womens state pension age will reach in it will then rise along with mens to between and however government proposals in the pensions bill seek to accelerate the increase in the state pension age such that it rises to by for women two years earlier than planned and to by for both men and women this is a clear breach of the coalition agreement which stated the government would review the rise to though womens state pension age would not start to rise to until the alarming impact is that with just a few years notice women will have to work for more than a year longer some of them will have to work for exactly years longer this means losing up to in pension income and up to for those eligible for pension credit this is before passported benefits such as bus passes prescriptions and council tax support have been taken into account these proposals have little support and more than people have signed a petition against them it is clear that even government mps are getting nervous about these changes that are unfair unnecessary and unjust so i am using the opportunity presented by this debate to urge the government to rethink while they still have the time the attacks on womens pensions sure start child benefit and services are not inevitable they are the choice that this government have made by choosing to cut too far and too fast this government is threatening the protection and benefits that are the most popular and that provide the most support in good and bad times to women up and down this country women must no longer be the shock absorbers for the governments agenda i am urging that we move forward in a way that doesnt turn the clock back on womens equality something

reading the description of the human centipede ii i can feel my anticensorship inclinations shrivel up along with my appetite according to the guardians summary in the sequel a man becomes erotically obsessed with a dvd copy of the original film in which the victims are surgically stitched together mouth to anus and decides to recreate the idea the film then focuses on his fantasies and the torture he inflicts one scene involves him wrapping barbed wire around his penis and raping the woman at the end of the centipede having become aroused by the sight of his victims being forced to defecate into each others mouths excuse me if i cant get my liberal urges up for coprophagia coprophilia extreme mutilation and sexual violence all at the same time the british board of film classification bbfc has banned it from all forms of release my personal line is that the bbfcs role should be one of guidance not prohibition except where scenes of unsimulated cruelty and violence are concerned all the same human centipede ii sounds so obviously contrived to bait moral opinion its slightly gratifying to see it shut down director tom six wanted outrage and he got so much of the stuff that the film will only be distributed in the uk as an illegal download yes i am smirking a little bit the notveryengaging original was an example of horror extremity in its own right although its position as king of the nasties was quickly superceded by a serbian film which came out about a month later this fakesnuff odyssey throws out some of the vilest sexual violence including a madeup genre called newborn porn which is what youd imagine and realised with blessed crapness while the plot pretends to be condemnation of porns degrading effects or maybe its a political metaphor for how governments rape us from the moment were born as the director says in an interview or maybe its just a lazy excuse to string together a bunch of tryhard shock scenes horror has acquired a reputation for increasing harshness over the last decade a trend often linked to the saw movies with their taste for baroque murder and intense suffering of the victims but horror connoisseur sarah dobbs reckons thats an unfair cultural burden to put on the films the term torture porn implies that the films are inviting their audience to enjoy the torture which i dont think is really the case arguably those films actually have a pretty solid moral core but why should that really matter films are films and people enjoy different things and while saw has had a huge influence how could a series with a such an extraordinary record of profit fail to were not by any means living in some kind of horror sodom horror is an exploitation genre a feverish stew where hacks and geniuses get their breaks thanks to a tradition of relatively cheap production and few creative barriers think anustomouth sutures are indefensible how about the dismemberment of a live turtle for the camera nothing done by tom six is as truly outrageous as the real cruelty seen in mondo films such as cannibal holocaust and at the same time that horror fosters probable sociopaths its worth remembering that david cronenberg and peter jackson both started out as makers of video nasties horrors dedication to unsettling viewers makes it perfect for directors with a seething sense of whats underneath everyday life a film like martyrs is almost unwatchably cruel but its got more to say about violence suffering and voyeurism than any number of fleshrending blockbusters you get extremes of intelligence and stupidity as well as extremes of unpleasantness in horror and if were happy to start banning stuff because of the latter we might be losing a lot of stuff that falls into the former camp maybe my smirk is

that women accounted for of all convictions for domestic violence last year will come as a surprise to many but what is not clear is whether the growing numbers of women convicted a increase in five years represents a rise in actual cases of femaleperpetrated domestic violence domestic violence has traditionally been understood as a crime perpetrated by domineering men against defenceless women research spanning over years has however consistently found that men and women selfreport perpetrating domestic violence at similar rates professor john archer from the university of central lancashire has conducted a number of metaanalytic reviews of these studies and found that women are as likely to use domestic violence as men but women are twice as likely as men to be injured or killed during a domestic assault men still represent a substantial proportion of people who are assaulted injured or killed by an intimate partner and respectively if the empirical research is correct in suggesting that between a quarter and half of all domestic violence victims are men a question follows why has womens domestic violence towards men been unreported for so long and what has changed in the last five years to make it more visible one reason may be the feminist movement feminism took up the cause of domestic abuse of women in the s with the worlds first womens refuge being opened by erin pizzey in feminism understood domestic violence as the natural extension of mens patriarchal attitudes towards women leading men to feel they had the right to control their partners using violence if necessary feminists campaigned successfully to bring the issue into the public arena thereby securing resources to establish services to help victims this activism and advocacy led to governmental and public acceptance that domestic violence was synonymous with violence against women paradoxically feminist concerns for female victims may also have led to the recent increase in arrests of female perpetrators the disparity between prevalence study statistics and criminal conviction data of male domestic violence perpetration led us feminists to successfully campaign for mandatory arrest policies for domestic violence callouts mandatory arrest policies coincided with a threefold increase in the number of women arrested in the uk a proarrest policy was also introduced requiring police forces to always consider an arrest in domestic violence cases although not eliminating police discretion the policy undoubtedly diminished individual police officers discretionary powers the increase in female arrests for domestic violence suggests that when police officers were freer to exercise discretion it was exercised more frequently in favour of female perpetrators support for a feminist conceptualisation of domestic violence has been afforded by mens generally more visible violent behaviour men make up the majority of perpetrators of violence in public places such as football matches and nightclubs as men appear to be more ready willing and able to use violence outside the home the logical extension is that men are more violent than women per se this argument has frequently been cited by researchers such as professors russell and emerson dobash as evidence against the veracity of figures showing large numbers of male victims of domestic violence while ignoring the fact that mens aggression in public places is almost always directed towards other men in recent years female violence has become a more public affair with changes in drinking patterns being a likely contributing factor to more women being arrested for violent offences outside of the home in addition the widespread use of cctv may have provided sufficient evidence for the police and cps to override stereotypes of women as nonviolent the erosion of the passive female stereotype is likely to result in more women being charged and convicted of offences generally which might also result in increases in the conviction rates for womens domestic violence the dual stereotypes of the violent man and passive woman have undoubtedly obscured the existence of male victims of domestic violence in the past men were also unlikely to view their own victimisation as either domestic violence or a criminal assault and so were unlikely to seek help large sums of money have been spent on educational campaigns to encourage female victims to seek help until there are similar campaigns for men it is unlikely that the true number of male victims needing help will be known if the current trends continue however women may find themselves increasingly likely to be charged with domestic assault and men more likely to be offered help and protection,2011-06,woman accounted

holly dustin voluntary regulation wont change a thing from glittery padded bras for prepubescent girls to raunchy x factor performances by rihanna and christina aguilera concern about the proliferation of sexualised products on the high street and highly sexualised media imagery is growing in a review backed by no reg bailey of the mothers union is calling for voluntary regulation by business and the media industry followed by stronger action if this fails the risk is that this plays to a moralistic agenda that is less about women and girls equality and more to do with the repression of young peoples sexuality and rights indeed tasked by the government to look at this issue the mothers union and why not an expert child or womens rights organisation has focused on parental concern and not the rights of young people themselves the end violence against women evaw coalition has repeatedly called for the review to be joined up with the home offices strategy on violence against women to make links with sexual consent and sexual exploitation for example but to no avail nevertheless the bailey review highlights a real problem our sexualised culture reinforces stereotypes of women and girls as sexual objects who are sexually available to men and boys and sends strong messages about what it means to be a man or a woman this may negatively influence girls aspirations a survey found that of girls aged considered glamour modelling their ideal profession while a quarter of girls cited lap dancer as their top choice critically sexualisation also creates a culture in which violence against women and girls is normalised and justified pornography is increasingly accessed by boys at a younger age and research suggests that this influences young mens expectations of sexual relationships a yougov poll for evaw found that a third of girls had experienced unwanted sexual touching in uk schools and a nspcc study found that of girls aged in an intimatepartner relationship had experienced sexual violence from a partner unfortunately experience tells us that voluntary codes of conduct do not work so the government should get tough on regulating those who are profiting from the sexualisation of our culture however this is only part of the answer and because the bailey report does not start from a womens or childrens rights perspective it fails to recognise the importance of empowering young people mandatory sex and relationships education which includes sexual consent gender stereotypes healthy relationships and media literacy has a vital role to play in ensuring that students are equipped with the skills and information they need to deal with sexualisation if it is serious about tackling this issue the government must develop public campaigns promoting respect for women and girls and link action on sexualisation to its strategy on ending violence against them jane fae asking the right question would be a start there is something wrong with this debate debate sorry not even that its verdict first evidence nowhere as a bizarre coalition of prudes dudes and guilttripping parents pile in behind david cameron on the latest moral panic the narrative is simple our yoof by which they mean girls is being sexualised whatever that means by the dark forces of irresponsible commercialism something must be done the answer broadly is more modesty for boys er no our sixyearold regularly covets tshirts extolling the virtues of some superviolent hero or bearing slogans such as if i dont get my way there will be trouble what an admirable asboinducing sentiment yet the media and bailey are mostly silent on such things this is all about girls what girls wear and how girls may be perceived that this report should appear in the same week as slutwalk goes live around the uk is an irony i hope will not be lost on guardian readers it is yet again about men blaming and shaming femaleness for the fact that some just cant keep their libido in check being able to counter this view is next to impossible as dr clarissa smith said addressing a conference of the onscenity network academics who have focused on understanding sexual imagery and its effects on our culture the moment anyone categorises an image or an action as sexual theres an end to rational discussion you cant put the contrary view without being derided as having an agenda as though those who find sexualisation in all they see havent and condemned for it so heres the problem the bailey review is not research its conducted by someone who is a big cheese in the christian mothers union and was chief exec of the danish bacon company not obvious qualifications for this study and its predicated on questionnaires that appear laden with leading questions everyone knows what sexualisation is so why bother with any real attempt to pin it down to something that could be studied seriously academically meaningfully but it fits with a zeitgeist a narrative that sees the exceptional as commonplace views childish experimentation through adult eyes and so inflicts the very sexualisation it claims to be against and subtly places responsibility for bad things happening in the victim not in the perpetrator the real problem with bailey is not just that its the wrong answer its the wrong question what society needs to be doing is

if a newspaper publishes a style guide to ensure the accurate and consistent use of words and terms the equal and opposite reaction that naturally follows is a series of requests for changes in those rules it is healthy that the guidelines are tested and editors should respond to changing public attitudes it is not always right or necessary to chase demotic style but few would regret the changes in public attitudes that have followed the development of a different kind of language used to describe mental ill health or physical disabilities readers have strong views on the language which range from irritation at the misuse of might and may mea culpa in an early column or bored of rather than with to more powerful changes they would like to see implemented in the guardians style guide one such request came after a columnist writing about superinjunctions a word that is often misused to mean all injunctions including very occasionally in the guardian produced the following sentence child porn on the net is censored and its users prosecuted the reader had very strong objections to the phrase child porn he said please can you not call it this in future articles of this nature child porn is both a very offensive and trivialising term to use especially but not exclusively to people who have been abused and filmed they have suffered an everlasting offence he argues being abused and exploited as children and then knowing that this is online somewhere for ever these images or films are of children being sexually abused or exploited quite literally crimescene photos or films porn they could only be described as if the media is aiming their stories at paedophiles indecent images is a far more accurate and acceptable term the more such images are described as porn the more it suggests an element of consenting adults the more this legitimises this crime in the eyes of the offenders and also my own view the more it normalises it in society he writes currently there is no entry in the guardians style guide that covers this area the new oxford dictionary of english defines pornography as printed or visual material containing the explicit description or display of sexual organs or activity intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings i dont think its the case that all adult pornography is legal but much is and for the present discussion we will put aside a further argument about the demeaning and corrosive effect it may have on individuals who view it but the reader makes a strong point that he then reinforces by describing the attitude of child welfare organisations to the term for instance the internet watch foundation which fights child abuse on the web states the iwf uses the term child sexual abuse content to accurately reflect the gravity of the images we deal with please note that child pornography child porn and kiddie porn are not acceptable terms the use of such language acts to legitimise images which are not pornography rather they are permanent records of children being sexually exploited and as such should be referred to as child sexual abuse images if you see such content online please report it to the iwf the nspcc only uses the term child abuse images the reader adds this is what the nspcc have previously said to me the nspcc would agree with you that the expression child porn gives a misleading and potentially trivialising impression of what is a very serious crime the nspcc typically uses the term child abuse images as we consider this offers a more accurate indication of what these images portray david marsh the editor of the guardians style guide agrees as do i that this is a sensible change to the way the guardian refers to images of child abuse he intends to create a new entry in the guide and inform all staff of the new style of course a new style guide entry doesnt stop the terrible abuse of children but when we describe such images it will separate a despicable crime from a broader area of human sexual activity that washes back and forth across moral and legal boundaries that are harder to define,2011-06,newspaper publishes style guide

the notion that maternity leave should be abolished is easy to dismiss as a ludicrous piece of blue sky thinking by one of the prime ministers inner circle of trusted advisers steve hilton david camerons director of strategy is known for thinking the unthinkable portrayed as a maverick who wanders around no in his socks he is said to have nine mad ideas for every good one a spoof website the steve hilton policy generator throws up suggestions such as return to vhs to abolish online piracy just to see what happens or make children sweep chimneys to make things more fun no need to worry then he comes out with this stuff all the time one senior whitehall source said after news of the idea emerged last week he is madder than any of the caricatures around but what then of the governments cuts to childcare provision sure start services and working tax credits and what are women to make of recent research from the fawcett society the gender equality group which found those hardest hit by the triple whammy of cuts to jobs benefits and services were single mothers despite all the talk of familyfriendly policies and cameron and nick clegg insisting on taking paternity leave and doing the school run perhaps hiltons remarks are just further proof of the conservatives blind spot when it comes to motherhood there are serious signs across the government not just of a carelessness about womens lives but of an ideological approach which risks turning the clock back said yvette cooper the shadow home secretary and minister for women it is hard to imagine anyone who has any idea about working mothers or their importance to the british economy proposing the abolition of maternity leave unless of course they think mothers shouldnt work at all coopers intervention could be passed off as party politicking but even within the coalition there is some evidence that hiltons plan was following a direction of travel not entirely alien to the government this month the minister for equalities lynne featherstone a liberal democrat publicly warned government departments and local authorities that they will be in breach of equality laws if they do not examine the potential for cuts to fall disproportionately on women last year the fawcett society said that of the bn in savings from cuts to jobs benefits and services announced in the emergency budget of june bn or was being borne by women compared with by men featherstone rejects the blind spot thesis but when asked to justify the fact that women were being hit hardest by public sector job cuts she said you cant make an omelette without cracking eggs critics say there have been too many omelettes many families have seen their income fall thanks to changes to working tax credits and a lowering of the threshold for receiving them the proportion of childcare costs that a parent can claim back from the government has already been reduced and the observer revealed earlier this year that ministers are considering almost halving the childcare allowance for some parents it would reduce the amount a family with two children can claim from to about a week there has been a m cut to playbuilder funding a labour government programme to build more playgrounds a cut to funding for childcare provision and sure start with the removal of ringfencing has resulted in many councils withdrawing scaling back or charging extra for services such as holiday childcare and leisure activities justine roberts cofounder of the website mumsnet said it seems rather ironic that the coalition government agreement included a promise to make our society more familyfriendly weve yet to see much evidence of this parents are struggling with some of the highest childcare costs in europe static wages and the prospect of reduced child benefit and tax credits for many siobhan courtney who has a fourmonthold son alban has given up the job she loved as a television journalist because the numbers do not add up she and her partner live in st albans hertfordshire and both work in london we are on the threshold and arent entitled to any tax credits she said if i send my son to nursery ill be going to work just to cover his nursery fees and my commuting fares thats bonkers many new mothers ive met say the same im going to freelance but the trouble with ad hoc work is that you have to pay for childcare whether or not any work comes in i dont want to come across as some sort of middleclass bleating woman but it does seem unfair its a really tricky time luciana berger the labour mp for liverpool wavertree said the squeeze on women and families was a constant topic of discussion in her constituency surgeries from cutting funding for childcare and working tax credits to closing sure start centres and changing the state pension affecting women aged and particularly hard this toryled government has systematically pursued policies that disproportionately affect women ive been inundated with representations from female constituents a year on from the coalitions first budget research from the fawcett society and the institute for fiscal studies has found that single mothers are the most affected and after all the changes can expect to lose of their net annual income by anna bird acting chief executive of the society said childcare is getting more expensive incomes are falling and the tax credits that add to low income are being reduced single mothers are facing difficult decisions about whether they can afford to go out to work these women want to be role models for their daughters too its the role models well lose that will have the biggest impact one lone parent who is finding life a financial struggle is victoria hopkins a human resources manager from west yorkshire i would really like to see the government offering more assistance in the way of tax relief to single working mothers like myself she said i get no financial assistance from my daughters father because his business went into administration my annual salary is which i appreciate is ok but by no means is it a huge wage i have to cover my outgoings and on the weeks that my daughter is on school holidays i have to pay a week for childcare this equates to nearly a year and the contribution from the government via tax credits is a year pitiful i am contributing to society by working i am contributing to the economy through my taxes im being a good role model for my fiveyearold daughter where is the incentive for me to work id be better of being a stayathome mum living off benefits its ridiculous siobhan freegard cofounder of the website netmums calls women in this situation ledgers it sums up what a huge proportion of the working mothers who talk to us feel she said they are on this ledge where they are just coping but if one thing changes for example when they get a tax credit review and are told they are going to be worse off or they have to take unpaid time off because a child is sick or theres a snow day it tips them off the ledge we have women with jobs telling us they are worse off than if they didnt work but they are hanging on because in a years time one child will start school and their childcare costs will fall sharon hodgson the labour mp for washington and sunderland west said she believed the government was targeting women with children because they were the demographic least likely to vote the worst things they did last year people have forgotten about getting rid of the child trust fund the baby bond the health in pregnancy grant added to all the things they have done recently is all targeted at women and families tory mps reject the notion that the governments way out of economic problems is to make women suffer more and the latest intake of the parliamentary party insist that they are different from their predecessors certainly they claim there is no ideological motivation i would say this is more woman and familyfriendly than previous governments said damian hinds the mp for east hampshire it is probably an evolution over time but also the result of having a man in downing street with a young family and nick clegg with a young family too of course there have been cuts but i genuinely think there is a real will to address problems such as multigenerational worklessness and dysfunctional households the design of the new benefits system is an enormously ambitious project and there are obstacles we need to overcome but there is nothing ideological about this not at all shortly after the coalition took power hilton spoke at a staff meeting in downing street described by one of those who attended as inspirational hilton stressed he was interested in three things transparency big society and family the fawcett society said last week it was hugely encouraged by the modern workplace consultation which is looking at extending the right to request flexible working and changing parental leave so fathers can take a greater role in their childs first year but perhaps the government should look to france for truly familyfriendly policies mothers there are helped by free preschools family allowances tax deductions and four months of maternity leave on full pay or would this be too much for even the wackiest of bluesky thinkers,2011-07,notion maternity leave abolished easy dismiss ludicrous piece blue

sometimes i wonder if years hence we as a society will decide that it doesnt make sense to grant women coveted spots in advanced programmes in business law science or medicine because by then it will be obvious that the vast majority of women who are eligible for such positions women who are extremely bright and talented arent really interested in following through on their professions and taking up the responsibilities of leadership because it will be clear that after receiving the benefits of to years of training most women opt out leave their responsibilities and seek fulfilment within the traditional roles of wife and mother in the future we collectively might shrug our shoulders and say well it just isnt working to try to get women on corporate boards or as half the elected officials in government or at the top of any profession because women have proven through their choices that they would rather not i hope it doesnt come to that all of my adult life i have advocated for a womans right to choose her own destiny choice was the mantra of the womens movement of the s and s we now have the freedom to choose in ways that are unprecedented never before in human history have women had the freedom to shape our destiny as we have now which is my point our choices are determining the future and those choices are reenacting the past far more than they are creating a radically new and different future for us all some argue that its only a matter of time girls are doing exceedingly well in school outpacing their male peers in almost every subject maths being one in which boys still often outperform girls more girls than boys assume leadership in secondary school in academics extracurricular activities and student governance more girls than boys are heading off to university however despite the fact that theres been a lot of hand wringing over the alarming fact that boys are being left behind few realise that these trends are not recent girls have been outperforming boys in leadership in secondary school across the board for close to years the stark fact is that the majority of young women dont navigate the unruly and unpredictable complexities of life with the ease that they take on the welldefined tasks demanded by school a recent study by princeton university of its own bestandbrightest student body revealed that their female students who were such stars in high school shrink away from leadership in college secondary school is the place where female leadership peaks rather than being the training ground for the future we tend to point the finger at the inequities that still exist as the reason that women throw in the towel and give up on public leadership for private life certainly the lack of real mentorship ingrained cultural patterns whereby women still bear the brunt of housework and childcare and inadequate policies around parental leave and child support are all important factors but theres more to the picture more that rests in womens hands despite our talent brilliance and desire to make a mark we havent really been ready to fully take up the opportunities that have opened to us our desires to lead and to create a new future for all of us are far less strong and insistent than the traditional drives for security motherhood and being the object of love this doesnt have to be an eitheror but if we opt out it becomes so we dont see ourselves where we actually are poised through our actions to create a new culture after hundreds of thousands of years where womens sole purpose was childbearing its no wonder that we feel more pulled by the weight of tradition rather than seek to use our choices to make history if we want to create a world where women can assume leadership as well as lead rich family lives we cant opt out of leadership we must seize the moment to consciously choose to create a fresh future rather than unconsciously recreate the past,2011-07,sometimes wonder year hence

julie bindel defends the screening of the documentary film hardcore implying that ours and other feminist organisations do not think women should view pornography the hardcore truth about women in porn g july this belief could not be further from the truth bindel writes feminist group scottish women against pornography swap says the documentary should never be screened because it is a filmed rape of felicity which will be endlessly reenacted long after she is gone in fact swap has always used pornography where necessary to challenge pornography presenting a petition to press the scottish parliament for a change in legislation to deal with pornography we were instructed that on no account could we show any of the material we brought with us as evidence we have been working for more than a decade to highlight pornography and its role in violence against women and children and have no doubt that in order to understand porn and fight against it women have to view it irrespective of how uncomfortable or distressing it is to them the difference is swap uses porn images from a feminist perspective for training and information bindel states in the early s women against violence against women compiled a slide show of pornographic images and activists including myself gave presentations to antipornography womens groups swap and other antiporn organisations are currently doing the same using swap resources and the antiporn training slide show who wants to be a porn star accompanying it is a script which takes the audience through each slide providing context and meaning to the distressing images this proves that it is possible to expose the abuse degradation violence and coercion of women in the porn industry without exploiting or dehumanising the women involved the slide show continues to mobilise women to take action against the porn industry why did swap oppose the screening of hardcore we need to know the truth about the porn industry to campaign against it hardcore tells the truth says bindel but it is a commercial film and we believe it was motivated by profit and its effect was to titillate viewers by filming the ordeal of a young woman our concerns are for her and innumerable other women and girls who never have the power to destroy filmed acts of male sexual violence committed against them is it feminist to promote and condone male sexual exploitation of women by attempting to relabel it as a documentary the footage of felicity after the filming in deep distress about the relationship with her father is harrowing and gives us an insight as to why she may have become involved in porn hardcores director and producer have portrayed themselves as victims and serious about exposing the harm of the porn industry yet we have never heard of them donating any of the profits of their film to organisations working to end pornography,2011-07,julie bindel defends screening documentary film hardcore implying feminist organisation

last week jamie leigh jones lost a civil lawsuit against her former employer the private military contracting firm kbr jones had accused several of her colleagues of violent gang rape to which kbr responded by insisting she settled the matter through private arbitration rather than a civil court it took four years for jones to be granted her day in court after two days of deliberation a federal jury decided that her claims were untrue although joness case was thrown out it touched upon a prevalent yet gravely underrepresented problem within the us military according to military reporter adam

the brute cynicism with which the mail on sunday last weekend called for a clares law to warn women about a partners violent past should come as no surprise any resemblance to campaigning tabloids living or dead was doubtless entirely deliberate the proposal modelled on sarahs law was officially launched this week by hazel blears mp and michael brown the father of clare wood who was murdered in by a man she had met online it later emerged that woods killer had a history of violence against women including harassment threats and kidnapping at knifepoint domestic violence is at epidemic levels in this country resources for those escaping it are badly funded and underimagined so there is a temptation to greet any mooted improvement with a betterthannothing shrug but this particular suggestion deserves critical consideration not only because of what it reveals about societys systemic failure to address domestic abuse it also highlights how technology has altered what the public believes it has a right to know the specifics of the scheme which home secretary theresa may has said shell consider over the next few weeks remain fuzzy it appears partly pitched at offsetting the stranger danger of online dating as though introductions over the village pump were inevitably more salubrious the new national police database certainly makes public access a more practical proposition though a bespoke domestic violence register was shouted down by the charity refuge and others as at best barely workable and at worst dangerous when it was first suggested by the then home secretary jacqui smith information could be released in response to people raising concerns about an individual as with the child sex offender disclosure scheme prompted by the news of the worlds naming and shaming campaign in the wake of the murder of eightyearold sarah payne which allows parents and carers to formally ask the police to tell them if someone who might have access to their children has a record of child sexual offences more controversial is the possibility of the police proactively alerting people if a new partner has a flagged history of violence regardless of whether a formal approach for information has been made the fact is that plenty of women already know theyre at risk of domestic abuse but dont get the help they need the violent history of clare woods killer was after all revealed by an independent police complaints commission investigation which criticised the way greater manchester police had handled woods previous allegations that he had harassed assaulted and threatened to kill her regardless of the vocal commitment of senior officers too many women encounter unsympathetic local police aside from the obvious risks of data mismanagement a disclosurebyrequest scheme seems peculiarly inappropriate given what we know about the process of domestic violence perpetrators isolate their victims control and violence builds slowly over time and only of victims ever go to the police if a woman is warned but the relationship is in its early stages and she convinces herself that things will be different this time how much more vicious will the national sport of victimblaming be when she finally reports an assault worse what happens when she confronts her new boyfriend with the information she has received this shift of responsibility from police and perpetrator to potential victim may be couched in the language of empowerment but in essence it is a distraction not only from failure to enforce existing legal protections but also from the coalitions devastating cuts to refuges housing benefit legal aid jobseekers allowances and the rest that will trap women in violent relationships and this is not a theoretical assertion its happening across the country right now beyond this it is curious that may should be entertaining such a scheme when preelection the conservatives were so critical of the number of agencies holding personal data currently the government is loosening vetting restrictions as part of its war on red tape but thats politics for you it would probably be churlish to add that sarahs law pilots and the longerstanding megans law in the us show no demonstrable effect on reducing offences against children it is also curious how in making reference to internet relationships wood met her killer on facebook a wider anxiety about online dissemblance is exploited as though concealing a history of violence against women and fudging ones smoking habits have a moral or at least technological equivalence for we are all caught between the increasing centralisation and commodification of an individuals data and networked lives where sharing personal information with virtual strangers has become the norm a law that allows certain people access to data must operate in a context where information spread exaggeration and decontextualisation is viral and the consequences are too fresh to map the googleability of almost everyone has been changing the way we relate to others for more than a decade it must also have changed what we think we have a right to know about other people

rowenna davis the big pieces of the puzzle are missing dear maurice what does blue labour offer women with its emphasis on family neighbourliness place and community the movement openly calls for a return to labours small c conservative roots you believe past administrations have been too heavyhanded with the state and too lighttouch with the market the partys traditional discourse on equality leaves you cold i believe this approach throws up three big problems for women that id like to discuss the first concerns womens role in blue labour society youre calling for a return to a set of values and traditions that were built at a time when women remained largely in the home if britons did spend more time with community and family it was largely because women had little choice but to work as fulltime carers and neighbours rather than independent economic agents can our society return to those conservative values without going back to a model of female subservience second blue labour is committed to shifting focus from the state to the community as alan finlayson summarises new labour your movement believes blindly reduced politics to the individual it was too managerial bureaucratic and top down instead we need to rekindle our moral commitment to associations outside westminster and whitehall be they church groups trade unions workers boards or residents associations as an avid community worker im inclined to agree but lets not forget helen goodmans point that liberal rights and the role of the state has done a lot to help women and many other groups for that matter break out of community bonds that have often been oppressive unaccountable and male dominated as sunder katawala says we already have a society that celebrates community association subject to individual rights do you really want our community bonds to become thicker than that finally economics blue labour doesnt seem to have anything to say on taxation the deficit or the spending cuts which are disproportionately affecting women yes your commitment to a living wage and an end to zero hours contracts are both excellent for women but the big pieces of the puzzle are still missing in your defence i know that you have said that a central feature of the movement is resistance to commodification through democratic organisation but when it comes to giving an economic value to caring work womens labour and divorce rights this commodification has actually helped us quite a bit too if when you talked about the family you said a bit more about paternity and maternity rights id listen if your notion of a community group worth connecting with included feminist groups progressive online communities and campaigns rather than a narrow focus on traditional faith groups youd be more likely to win me round perhaps if there were more women listed as running your movement or your blog these points would have been addressed earlier best wishes rowenna maurice glasman blue labour only empowers women dear rowenna what does blue labour say about the rightful position of women in society powerful thats the short answer with a vocation with assets and partnership if they wish to be with children and capable of negotiating from strength if they dont sure start sure started well as a form of relational solidarity with poor mothers but it didnt move in the right direction wishing to sever the mothers from their children and push them into badly paid and unrewarding jobs childcare and vocation must be the double offer to women and to men we need more negotiation at home and a more equal distribution of assets and partnership to carers so they have time for friendship and public life as concerns your second point i am far more ambiguous and wary of community than you claim i prefer to use words like association congregation relationships solidarity mutuality civility friendship my love of liberty of expression association and vocation and my commitment to a meaningful life lived from within according to commitments that are internally affirmed put me closer to the liberal side of the argument in the terrible interminable tedious and life sapping liberalcommunitarian debate but do not infer from that that i am a liberal it is just an indication of how awful communitarianism can be tacitly statist casually authoritarian intellectually vacuous the meaningful life is one shaped by the necessity and tension of both liberty and love while i support entirely and have exploited throughout my life the right to exit from oppressive community ties i also support the right of people to stay and to renegotiate their place within that community there should be no coercion and oppression within communities there has to be equal access to educational excellence for all children and not an imbalance between boys and girls in faith communities for example any experience within communities reveals an endless argument over what it means a constant renegotiation of terms relational reciprocity lays down the limits i am astonished as to what people think i might think and i consider domestic oppression of all sorts to be wicked and evil and a violation of the good domestic violence should be punished severely wherever we find it one of the great things i learned in london citizens was that there was a lot more to congregations associations organisation and institutions than oppression faith traditions for example can carry ethics and practices that defy market domination the interest rate cap that we proposed of was carried overwhelmingly by christians and muslims who were outraged by the fact that banks were borrowing at half a percent and charging poor people hundreds of times that it was a very successful campaign in the postcrash era characterised by a stupefied silence we have much to learn from faith communities about the art of association and the preservation of solidarity and ethics i work closely with people in greenpeace have worked with uk uncut and am now engaged in an excellent discussion with paul hilder on precisely the best combination of facetoface organising and new social media i would not limit this to progressive online campaigns but once again how to combine them in a politics of relationships that can generate a common good this is the work at hand how to turn obamas campaign into a dayin dayout party strategy of relationship building organising and campaigning about things that people care about like their forests and their families their parents and their parks blue

marriage confers little if any benefit in terms of a childs development according to new research challenging the rationale behind the prime ministers desire to offer tax breaks to couples who tie the

secretary iain duncan smith but is opposed by lib dems the work by the ifs accepts that those who marry tend to be relatively better educated and relatively better off but the institute points out differences in outcomes between children whose parents are married and those who cohabit may simply reflect these differences in other characteristics rather than be caused by marriage by examining data from the millennium cohort study a sample of children born in the uk in the early s the institute shows that children born out of wedlock are behind in cognitive development at three five and sevenyearsold but this is because cohabiting parents tend to have lower educational qualifications than married parents the same pattern is observed with socioemotional development the thinktank said it had also repeated its work using another dataset to account for the idea that getting married could itself lead to changes in some of the things we want to control for like relationship quality

your report notes optimistically that female membership on british corporate boards now edges up to number of women appointed to boards doubles since lord davies set target july alongside this is a feature on norways quota system in which the state said at least of the board members of listed companies should be women norways rule proves mixed blessing for golden skirts july the article reported comments that the policy is somehow not benefiting women in business and not actually supporting equality the figure is now and a prominent group of norwegian women nicknamed the golden skirts have turned themselves into multiple board directors it states it is unfortunate that the derogatory term golden skirts was used the impact on company profits can be debated but the effect on gender equality is clearly positive in the norwegian case in a research project on gender in the boardroom i have led funded by the norwegian research council we have interviewed board members about their experiences since the quota was introduced we found that the new makeup did influence the decisionmaking process greater female representation seems to make meetings a little more pleasant the preparation material is tidier and more comprehensive and the processes more formal our respondents call it professionalisation this is in line with results from other research projects it is very hard to analyse the impact on profitability and research on the economic effect of more women on boards is inconclusive what is beyond doubt however is that the policy has paved the way for women to influence corporate decision making the article implies that the quota has not created more female managers in fact most golden skirts are nonexecutive directors it says and it points out the discrepancy between womens board representation and their singledigit share of executive positions while it will take time for the quota policy to affect the number of board executives it is very unlikely that the overall impact will be negative as elin hurvenes leader of the professional boards forum in oslo pointed out now headhunters are starting to look to the boards and pick up women for executive jobs norway may be a small country but it takes a lot of women to fill up the boards of its listed companies and companies initially not regulated by the quota law such as the norwegian agricultural cooperatives voluntarily adopted the rule women are now on the boards in significant numbers and not as passive skirts they have formed networks and are actively administering their share of the power to make decisions the experience women gain from corporate boards is qualifying them for executive jobs norwegian womens representation on the boards of listed companies was in in and is

is there anything good to be said about male sexuality that might seem a daft question apparently it brings a lot of pleasure and excitement to the lives of men and women alike its inspired some of the greatest art music and literature through the ages and has played a fairly substantial role in sustaining our species and populating the planet nonetheless youll need to search very very hard to find any positive appraisal of male heterosexuality since the era of the permissive society and the mainstreaming of modern feminism western society has gone a long way towards liberating womens sexuality younger women have to an unprecedented extent been encouraged to believe they can be as sexual as they like and to experience and express their desires as they wish even the ageold proscriptions on female promiscuity have been largely broken down exemplified by the glorious flowering of the slutwalk movement simultaneously and perhaps not coincidentally male sexuality has been increasingly seen as a problem you can hear it in the gentle dismissive mockery that says men are simple creatures who only want one thing or at the extreme outright vilification the male gaze threatens male desire is aggressive our primal instincts are pathologised with the jargon of gender studies righteous and necessary efforts to reduce sexual crimes have had the unwelcome effect of teaching generations of men that our sexuality can be dangerous and frightening dont believe me look back at the bailey review into the early sexualisation of children and the surrounding media hooha leaving aside any concerns about the veracity and accuracy of the report itself and i have plenty myself it is striking that acres of print were devoted to the impacts of these social trends on girls their selfesteem and body image their developing sexuality their safety and security barely a word was spoken about boys beyond fears that they are being turned into beasts again and again the message came out girls have problems boys are problems and yet does anyone doubt that there should be concerns about how easy access to porn impacts upon boys sexual development their selfesteem their body image or performance anxieties its not as if young men bask in perfect mental health and happiness young men commit suicide at nearly four times the rate of young women and sex and relationships rank high on their list of concerns at the other end of the age range sexually active older women are now widely eroticised albeit often with a rather misogynistic undertone as cougars or forgive me milfs while their male equivalents are disparaged as dirty old men observer columnist viv groskop recently went further opining about any older man who has sex outside marriage even the mildmannered old janitor john major saying unfortunately its not against the law to be an old lecher maybe it should be or at the very least you shouldnt be rewarded with the highest office in the land perhaps the greatest concern for men and women alike should be the way male sexuality and sexual expressiveness balances on a narrow tightrope of acceptability one step off the wire and you tumble into the realm of perversion as feminist blogger clarisse thorn noted last year any man who hits on a woman and gets it wrong risks being branded a creep sometimes deservedly so of course but often for no greater sin than being insufficiently attractive or socially skilled or having misread a perceived signal of invitation ive never heard of a woman being stigmatised or disparaged for expressing an attraction to big men rough men geeky men or whatever a man who expresses similar desires for women who dont conform to standard norms of beauty is a perv a fetishist a weirdo all of these prejudices are rehearsed and reiterated by men and women alike they reside in the intangible web of social norms conventions and culture but they can and must be challenged and changed if we can begin to openly and joyously celebrate the positives to male sexuality it might become easier for men to be happy and confident sexual partners and in turn become better lovers and sometimes better people male sexuality is no less diverse complex and wonderful than womens or for that matter no more base coarse and animalistic sure most men might be slightly more likely to let our gaze linger on eyecatching curves and slightly less likely to giggle about our lovers proclivities with our friends but in the grand picture women and men are surprisingly similar in this respect as in so many others women have been entirely justified in asking that we blokes respect their rights autonomy and wishes that we respect them as sexual beings it shouldnt be too much to ask for a little of the same in

police would be able to warn women if a new partner had a violent past under plans to reduce the number of deaths and injuries from domestic abuse being considered by the home secretary theresa may the growth of online dating coupled with the recent launch of a national police database has encouraged the government to look at new ways to protect potential victims a proposal for a clares law after yearold clare wood who met her murderer through an internet website is to be launched in london on monday by woods father michael and the former labour cabinet minister hazel blears who said may had written an encouraging letter on the issue woods killer george appleton set her body on fire before hanging himself in february an investigation by the independent police complaints commission later criticised individual and systemic failures in the way greater manchester police had handled woods previous allegations that appleton had harassed assaulted and threatened to kill her it emerged that he had a history of violence against women the campaign has won backing from louise casey the governments victims commissioner and the home office confirmed on sunday that it was looking closely at the idea which would also protect men seeking new partners blears mp for salford and eccles in whose constituency wood lived said women in clares situation often are unaware of their partners previous relationships and this can mean they start a relationship with someone with no idea if they have a violent past clares tragic death shows how vulnerable women arent always protected under the current law and until women are given the right to know if their partner has a history of serial domestic abuse they cant be sure of the risk that they face by changing the law we can empower women so that they can take informed action about their relationship and give them the chance to protect themselves and prevent domestic abuse from happening before it begins blears said two women a week died at the hands of violent partners or boyfriends and the arrival of a national police database meant providing better information had become a more practical proposition the trigger for release of information had yet to be determined but might either come in response to people raising concerns to the police over the behaviour of a partner or more controversially through the police proactively alerting people if a new partner had a history of violence flagged on the computer even if a formal approach for information had not been made in both instances the decision to release details would have to be approved at a meeting with other agencies such as the nhs or childrens services said blears there should be no free for all allowing people to go on fishing expeditions or try to settle scores if a woman chose to carry on a relationship so be it at least they are fully informed woods father michael told the mail on sunday my daughter wasnt stupid if she had known about that mans past she would have taken herself out of there in a heartbeat the home office said in a statement clares death was a tragic incident and its important that lessons are learned we are committed to doing all we can to protect victims of domestic violence including funding a network of independent domestic violence advisers and a national helpline for victims at the end of june we also launched domestic violence protection orders in three pilot areas to empower police officers and magistrates to stop offenders from contacting victims or returning to their home for up to days the first eighteen orders have been imposed by the courts so they are already bringing protection to victims but we will always consider what more can be done were looking at how the rollout of the police national database can further help forces identify and monitor repeat perpetrators providing further protection to victims the idea of clares law follows the introduction of sarahs law giving information on child sex

in discussions about more women on boards there are two competing arguments in favour one is that able women have just as much right to be there as their male counterparts the other that companies would be better run if they had more influential women during the banking crisis ruth sutherland in this paper argued that if there had been more females around they might have cooled the whitehot testosteronefuelled risk taking but banking women i know disagreed by the time they get there women are just the same its certainly unfair if a womans passed over for a less able man but many a mans been passed over that way too the more compelling argument has to be that women may be shrewd in a different way from men so the outfit will lose out if it only has a onesided view yet at a recent meeting by the womens group forum uk on bankers and ethics one woman denounced as discriminatory the idea that we bring anything special to the table as if the rules of commerce as played were the only gold standard that strikes me as absurd one thing we do bring anyway as the academic deborah tannen said is that men hate asking questions so when we ask the faces of males who didnt understand either clear all round the table,2011-07,discussion woman board two competing argument favour one able woman much right male counterpart company would better run influential woman banking crisis ruth sutherland paper argued female around might cooled whitehot testosteronefuelled risk taking banking woman know disagreed time get woman certainly unfair woman passed less able man many man passed way compelling argument ha woman may shrewd different way men outfit lose ha onesided view yet recent meeting womens group forum uk banker ethic one woman denounced discriminatory idea bring anything special table rule commerce played gold standard strike absurd one thing bring anyway academic deborah tannen said men hate asking question ask face male didnt understand either clear round table,"['discussion', 'woman', 'board', 'two', 'competing', 'argument', 'favour', 'one', 'able', 'woman', 'much', 'right', 'male', 'counterpart', 'company', 'would', 'better', 'run', 'influential', 'woman', 'banking', 'crisis', 'ruth', 'sutherland', 'paper', 'argued', 'female', 'around', 'might', 'cooled', 'whitehot', 'testosteronefuelled', 'risk', 'taking', 'banking', 'woman', 'know', 'disagreed', 'time', 'get', 'woman', 'certainly', 'unfair', 'woman', 'passed', 'less', 'able', 'man', 'many', 'man', 'passed', 'way', 'compelling', 'argument', 'ha', 'woman', 'may', 'shrewd', 'different', 'way', 'men', 'outfit', 'lose', 'ha', 'onesided', 'view', 'yet', 'recent', 'meeting', 'womens', 'group', 'forum', 'uk', 'banker', 'ethic', 'one', 'woman', 'denounced', 'discriminatory', 'idea', 'bring', 'anything', 'special', 'table', 'rule', 'commerce', 'played', 'gold', 'standard', 'strike', 'absurd', 'one', 'thing', 'bring', 'anyway', 'academic', 'deborah', 'tannen', 'said', 'men', 'hate', 'asking', 'question', 'ask', 'face', 'male', 'didnt', 'understand', 'either', 'clear', 'round', 'table']",14
if there is one thing guaranteed to frustrate women everywhere its the eternal queue for the ladies loo we have to wait in line with legs crossed in workplaces department stores clubs cinemas and theatres meanwhile men with their spacesaving urinals can smugly whiz in and out perhaps it is the fact that spacesaving urinals give them twice as many places to pee as women or perhaps it is the fact that most male architects town planners and sanitary engineers are unaware of the problem or maybe it is all just a cunning conspiracy to keep us indoors as women still do most of the shopping often with leaky toddlers in tow and need extra comfort breaks for menstruation and the bladder problems of pregnancy isnt it time there was a toilet revolution enter the londonbased womens design

an old controversy has arisen over pornography not the usual ruck about whether it is harmful to women but a debate over the viewing of women being abused during the making of it this monday uk feminista is screening the documentary hardcore which offers a horrifying glimpse into the industry first screened on channel in it follows felicity a yearold single mother living in the uk who is desperate to make money to improve her daughters opportunities she is invited by a porn agent to meet movers and shakers in the socalled us adult industry the audience watches as she goes from a bright sparky pretty woman to a cynical and emotionally exhausted shell her agent introduces her to performer max hardcore notorious for abusing and humiliating women during filming aware of his reputation for choking women during oral sex and that he often asks his costars to wear little girls clothes felicity did not want to meet him let alone work with him yet she is pressured by her agent until she agrees when hardcore chokes her she breaks down in tears but he insists on her continuing calling her a fucking loser and she is almost persuaded to continue until the documentary crew steps in for fear of being complicit in her rape feminist group scottish women against pornography says it should never be screened saying it is a filmed rape of felicity which will be endlessly reenacted long after she is gone but in the early s women against violence against women compiled a slide show of pornographic images and activists including myself gave presentations to antipornography womens groups the images ranged from playboy centrefolds to a hustler image of a woman being fed headfirst into a meat grinder and a cartoon of a learning disabled child being penetrated by a penis in one of her ears with the semen shooting out of the other undoubtedly a number of those at the meetings were upset but the knowledge gleaned was an essential tool with which to fight the liberals when they argue that porn is just pictures of people having sex other human rights campaigners rely on disturbing imagery to add strength to their arguments footage of animals being caged and tortured images of men being lynched in the american south by the ku klux klan pictures of mass graves in conflict zones uk feminista acknowledges the film makes difficult viewing but says it depicts the true face of the oftglamorised porn industry and importantly felicity who left the porn industry after the documentary did consent to the film being shown we need to know the truth about the porn industry to be

the minister for equalities is warning government departments and local authorities that they will be in breach of equality laws if they do not examine the potential for cuts to fall disproportionately on women lynne featherstone rejected mounting criticism that the coalition had a blind spot on women but when asked to justify the fact that women were being hit hardest by public sector job cuts said you cant make an omelette without cracking eggs in an interview with the guardian featherstone issued her reminder that any public sector job cuts or other deficit reduction plans that failed to consider equality rules would fall foul of the law under the equality act a new equality duty was introduced in april dictating that any public body must have regard to the equality implications of its decisions she said the equality duty means that the public sector will have to look at who is losing jobs and how those jobs are being lost because there is a duty to do so with regard to the act itself they must consider the impact of the cuts they are making and look to make sure that they are fair and thats the point of the equality duty in anything you do i remind colleagues endlessly labour has mounted a campaign highlighting the impact of the coalitions spending reductions on women arguing they are bearing the brunt of the cuts because women rely more heavily on the state for benefits and are more likely to work in the public sector featherstone liberal democrat mp for hornsey and wood green insisted the coalitions record for women was better than labours explaining the fall in womens support for both coalition parties she said maybe the harshness of the situation we find ourselves in as a result of having the biggest deficit in peacetime for some reason resonates with women she added the coalition government is actually delivering an awful lot for women there are some hard decisions weve had to take because the deficit is enormous im sure no parent wants to visit that deficit on their childrens future so its important before everything that we clear up the deficit that said this government is doing more than what labour did if you look at rape support under labour two centres a year were closing we are going to open four this year even in this age of austerity weve ringfenced money for those sort of things she listed plans to extend to hours the amount of free childcare available for twoyearolds from underprivileged families m to pay for carers who are more likely to be women to take breaks the right to request flexible working and the fact that the new state pension will be linked to earnings which should safeguard more money for women featherstone cited improvements in the economy as reassurance for women losing public sector jobs that they will find employment in the private sector as it recovers all of those things mean they will feed through to jobs for women and jobs for men she said the expectation is that those jobs will be created in the private sector and women will be able to get jobs in the private sector you cant make an omelette without breaking eggs but at the moment were cooking fiona mactaggart the shadow equalities minister accused the government of attempting to water down the equality duty in secondary legislation due to be debated in the house of commons on monday she said its extraordinary that she featherstone would compare the loss of womens jobs to cooking actually its peoples lives its thoughtless and heartless of course cuts resonate more with women because women are the people who deal with public services and they see first how they are cut women are the people who have had to make real changes to their spending patterns often before men,2011-07,minister equality warning

in the early s while women were setting up refuges organising for equal pay creating magazines called shrew and spare rib and red rag ann oakley was becoming intimately acquainted with her speculum her womens liberation group would buy the instruments at john bell amp croyden in central london and the idea was this demystification of the cervix she says a response to the fact that male doctors peered inside you yet you had no idea what was there our group produced a rather scandalous leaflet about selfexamination and it seemed terribly important at the time there are probably very few women she concludes sitting in her airy living room who have an exact mental image of what their cervix looked like in oakleys writing career was just starting then her book sex gender and society was published that same year the first in a string of radical works in her autobiography taking it like a woman she describes the change womens liberation wrought in her after a middleclass onlychild upbringing that included a deep teenage depression she went on to oxford married before graduation had two children by her mids and found herself depressed again it was womens liberation that saved her it turned the sadness to anger now professor of sociology and social policy at the institute of education university of london oakley has over the years published academic studies erotic stories and novels including the highly successful the mens room which became a bbc drama in the early s her work hasnt reached the same populist heights since then but it is still read and respected and at shes just produced a heavyweight biography that she says is probably her biggest book a critical woman charts the life of barbara wootton a social scientist and public intellectual who lived from to and whose achievements prompt the question why isnt she a household name oakley lists some of these in a breathless stream in the introduction the first woman to give lectures at cambridge university the first to be a member of a national policy commission the first to become a life peer in the house of lords where she became deputy speaker in it was wootton who got the bill to abolish capital punishment through the lords and on to the statute book her husband and brother were killed in the first world war and she had a deep antipathy to violence from then on she wrote books unpicking economics politics and the social sciences with a critical eye that often prompted anger she upset the entire establishment really says oakley time and tide magazine suspected she wielded more power than any other woman in the country while the new york times called her one of the ablest people in england and she did all this at a time when women were discriminated against in ways that now seem both cruel and absurd wootton gained special distinction in her economics exams at girton college cambridge an honour that hadnt been conferred on any student male or female in the history of the subject yet wasnt able to claim her degree no woman could and when she became the first woman to lecture at cambridge in aged her talks were advertised as being delivered by a mr henderson only a footnote revealed the lecturers true identity later in life she said that she and other women just accepted this huge discrimination says oakley professor richard titmuss oakleys father was a colleague of woottons at the university of london in the s and he brought her home for dinner when his daughter was oakley remembers wootton as highly formidable not easily approachable but the biography fleshes out a more nuanced character a woman who nursed a lifelong hatred of her mother whose first husband was killed just days into their marriage who lived with a female companion in later life in a small barn surrounded by donkeys it seems astonishing that wootton has been erased from our collective memory but women tend to be says oakley she was too radical and visionary too far ahead of her time also she worked in too many fields so it wasnt just crime and justice or economics or social welfare it was everything if wootton had been a man she would have been lord chief justice or something similar oakley suspects wootton was president of the young suffragist movement when they marched outside parliament in but she didnt embrace feminism as the second wave hit in the s thats one of her contradictions says oakley that she achieved so many firsts as a woman and was very much a pioneer but didnt identify with feminism oakley empathised with much of her subjects life and interests but on this point they obviously parted ways from the moment she joined a consciousnessraising group in the early s oakley was set to become one of the countrys leading feminist thinkers the group met each week to talk through experiences and frustrations and one of the key epiphanies was this acknowledgement that you could love your children very much find them absolutely wonderful yet also find the whole business of looking after them all the time entirely draining in her book housewife which drew on a study of womens lives she conducted for her phd oakley came to the radical conclusion that womens liberation depended on the total abolition of the housewife role the traditional family and gender roles wed only know this last goal was being achieved she wrote when men en masse are refusing to worry about the size and strength of their erections it seems safe to say were not quite there yet shes recently been involved in a study of firsttime mothers echoing one she carried out in the s and the picture was not fundamentally different women still take responsibility for all things domestic and there is this merging of housework and baby care its the patriarchal logic because youre feeding a baby you can iron my shirts peoples expressed ideologies and beliefs are somewhat different now but there is still this big gap between what people say they believe and what they actually do in practice in the days of the womens liberation movement she hoped wed have got further by now we really thought there was going to be a transformation of the entire social and political fabric because we had logic on our side why should women be treated differently to men why should they have fewer choices although oakley is glad fewer women now define themselves as housewives in some ways she thinks the pressure of combining work and home has become more difficult with little affordable childcare and households often dependent on two salaries for secondwave feminists it was never about getting women out to work she says it was about changing the whole system that forces people to choose between getting on a train at am or staying at home and feeling oppressed by having to be with delightful small children all the time one major cultural shift is that grandparents often provide free childcare now and share the burden of maternal guilt oakley says women her age are basically expected to be devoting quite a lot of their time to looking after grandchildren which i do but i feel the same kind of pressure and guilt in relation to my grandchildren as i did my own children i absolutely love spending time with them but i just want to do other things and thats the tension she doesnt feel theres much of a feminist movement in the uk at the moment and seems downhearted about the recent slutwalk if only because it showed how little we have progressed that its still necessary to argue that women arent responsible when theyre assaulted feminism is always present as a possibility though she says optimistically and you get these waves of womens movements periodically im waiting for the next one whether speculums will be necessary is anyones guess

pursuit of justice the department for international development announced funding of m a year for the next two years after his appearance at wednesdays launch event development secretary andrew mitchell told me the amount would be reassessed as part of a fouryear spending review were going to monitor it very carefully but we wanted to offer secure funding for the next two years perhaps stung by criticism of the uks tardiness given the lead the country has taken on supporting the new agency mitchell added that the figure was almost three times higher than the money previously committed to unifem the un body formerly dedicated to gender equality campaign groups that form the gender and development network have called for this money to be doubled to m in line with earlier commitments to unicef which is devoted to helping the worlds children this reasoning was one of the three most ludicrous things mitchell had heard he said adding that the uk was responsible for of un womens budget and just of unicefs the problem is that m is of the amount pledged six months after un women started rather than the m budget agreed by the general assembly less than a year ago six months after launch it has received just m in committed funding hence groups such as the vso womens institute and action aid believe the uk has flunked an opportunity to show real leadership its worth quoting vso chief executive marg mayne here when un women was created we believed that donors finally would start matching their words with resources alas we have seen a race to the bottom with donors competing by how little they can give germanys m and the united states m deserve particular mention andrew mitchell has constantly said that this government would lead international action to improve the lives of women and girls yet only m has been pledged to un women an organisation specifically set up to do just this while m has been given to the world bank this year an organisation that by the dfids own assessment scored poorly on its performance towards delivering gender equality so there you have it dfid has stumped up the cash and its more than it gave to an earlier agency that it criticised for being underresourced the m has also passed the daily mail test in that in has received no mention whatsoever from those in the media who believe any money on un agencies devoted to gender equality is a waste although it is a busy news week yet in failing to make a bigger contribution and perhaps shift some of the money used elsewhere to a cause its ministers consistently call one of the most effective uses of funding it has failed to make any splash at all its influence more or less limited to this column still dfid is one of the very few government bodies expected to see a tiny increase in its budget in given the commitment to setting the aid budget at of gdp this could actually mean a further increase barring a financial catastrophy its not a bad carrot to hold out to an organisation that now needs to prove itself as effective as its new boss former chilean president michelle bachelet seems to be show that the money is being well spent over the next two years and

there has been much recent criticism of the mix of the judiciary and the launch yesterday of a house of lords inquiry into the judicial appointments process led to a range of senior legal figures labelling the upper ranks as too white too male too elitist the facts speak for themselves only one woman sits in the supreme court of judges at the high court only three are from ethnic minorities and are female all but one of the supreme court judges went to oxbridge however i would warn against being too quick to throw out the much improved judicial selection process now run by the judicial appointments commission with the bath water should we instead look at the pool from which the judiciary is selected the bar standards board which i chair is responsible for the education and training requirements of barristers and it is a field we are constantly updating it is not surprising that in the recent past there has been far too small a group of senior women barristers from whom to select for judicial appointment when i studied law decades ago fellow female students were few and far between i am pleased to say that at entry level at least the mix of the profession has vastly improved since my day the bsbs recent report the bar barometer revealed that for the past few years women have at least equalled if not outnumbered men at the vocational stage of training once in practice however these figures drop to at the selfemployed bar of course it is not only about women our figures tell a similar story about race at vocational level of students are black and minority ethnic however at the selfemployed bar this figure becomes the problem appears to be retention barristers are leaving the profession before they reach sufficient seniority to be considered for judicial appointment as with other professions it may be the long hours the increasing demands of clients the lack of childcare facilities or the belief that flexible working is incompatible with service to clients even though chambers are ready to grant it in other words not a familyfriendly working culture alternative business structures may prove attractive in this respect but it remains to be seen whether they will be any less pressured and whether they will provide the judges of the future the bsb is playing its part in increasing diversity still further starting with proposed changes to our equality and diversity rules by which individual chambers and barristers will need to abide by all barristers who sit on interview panels will have received fair recruitment training before their involvement in selection we will also require chambers to gather diversity data on their workforce allowing us to have a better picture of how barristers progress through their careers most importantly we will insist that chambers will also have to have fair parental leave and flexibleworking policies we have also increased the absolute minimum salary for a pupillage placement from to per year to assist those who may otherwise be financially prohibited from training for the bar but our efforts may be undermined by the cuts about to be made to legal aid and the rise in tuition fees at university law students will not only graduate with debts but will lack the assurance that they had in the past that they could earn a modest living at the start of their careers by publicly funded family and criminal advocacy the inns provide substantial scholarships but these are swallowed up by the costs of the professional course we cannot change the judiciary on our own we need to work with barristers chambers and the inns of court to remove as many barriers to promotion as possible i have been working on the introduction of a bar nursery for some time and see this as a vital contribution from the profession allowing working parents the flexibility to work and to return after parental leave without having to worry about childcare while i have focused on diversity within the bar and the judiciary and the improvements i hope to see i dont think we should lose sight of the fact that judges whoever they are should be appointed on merit not by quotas and should understand and reflect the society they serve more importantly everyone should have confidence that justice will be done regardless of the colour gender or social background of the judge,2011-07,ha much recent

women like to write about sex in the last years alone women have written books about spanking anal sex prostitution swinging body fluids sampm casual sex tantric sex and sex over the age of these can be emotionally honest as well as oblique they are always sexually graphic often funny and feminist in their politics from chick lit to highend literary works they are written by exballerinas toni bentley the surrender tv presenters charlotte roche wetlands and academics catherine millet the secret life of catherine m whether as novels diaries blogs manuals or yes memoirs like my own with the kisses of his mouth they are written by women who have ventured beyond the norms of heterosexual society and behaved like reporters returning from their adventures in underground worlds to recount their stories personally im glad of these books they are valuable social documents and they show that the times are achanging yet sex is still riddled with social stigma and taboo church and state still patrol what is deemed ok moral loving and safe anyone who chooses to write about sex will attract stinging criticism from the moral right and so relatively speaking sexual memoirs are still rare and they are mostly written by women men by and large leave this subject alone somewhere its a given that men dont have anything too reflective to say about sex or they feel silenced by feminists where is the male suzanne portnoy the male melissa p what men will write honestly about their highs and lows their triumphs their sexual sorrows what man is brave enough to express himself freely about his desires few my guess is that male sexuality has been so heavily associated with violence that men suffer an even stronger taboo than woman best keep quiet male sex writers do exist but in much fewer numbers i met a shy man once karl webster who made a humorous reply to belle de jour but his bte de jour the intimate adventures of an ugly man didnt have comparable sales figures similar attempts seem to create less buzz its as if no one cares about what men do think or get up to sexually we all know what men are like while women are coming out on the subject men choose to stay quiet mostly men write about sex in novels in fiction we see flashes and glimpses of male sexual fantasy life mostly male writers hide behind their characters i also note that so far no literary editor has given my book to a man to review its as if sexuality is indeed a womens issue how would a male reviewer read my memoir would he be interested find it at all engaging or could a male reviewer get away with flaying me in my memoir i have exposed myself not just sexually but emotionally ive shown myself as weak sometimes naive and written about sexual rejection a reviewer says she finds my emotional candour more shocking than the sex i find this fascinating the british are very squeamish about emotions too is owning up to rejection a bigger taboo than sex i have written from the point of view of making what i thought was a colossal error sex i say ruined my life we have been given a formula for a valid relationship it must combine sexual and platonic love if a relationship isnt sexual it isnt the real thing yet love affairs come in every size and shape whether a person lives in passionate celibacy with another or in a blaze of erotic desire with someone they find annoying there are

there has been much sniggering in recent weeks over the call by catherine hakim for women to stop fussing over that year task of closing the pay gap and start investing their erotic capital instead the theory is that women have been fools not to exploit the much greater need for sex that men are reckoned to have and make some money out of it weirdly however a glance around the modern world suggests that far from pining away for lack of intercourse over these past few millennia men have been very busy developing systems for making money themselves women one suspects were too busy looking after the men theyd had sex with not to mention the children that ensued to get in on the act any earlier,2011-08,ha much sniggering recent week call catherine hakim woman stop fussing year task closing pay gap start investing erotic capital instead theory woman fool exploit much greater need sex men reckoned make money weirdly however glance around modern world suggests far pining away lack intercourse past millennium men busy developing system making money woman one suspect busy looking men theyd sex mention child ensued get act earlier,"['ha', 'much', 'sniggering', 'recent', 'week', 'call', 'catherine', 'hakim', 'woman', 'stop', 'fussing', 'year', 'task', 'closing', 'pay', 'gap', 'start', 'investing', 'erotic', 'capital', 'instead', 'theory', 'woman', 'fool', 'exploit', 'much', 'greater', 'need', 'sex', 'men', 'reckoned', 'make', 'money', 'weirdly', 'however', 'glance', 'around', 'modern', 'world', 'suggests', 'far', 'pining', 'away', 'lack', 'intercourse', 'past', 'millennium', 'men', 'busy', 'developing', 'system', 'making', 'money', 'woman', 'one', 'suspect', 'busy', 'looking', 'men', 'theyd', 'sex', 'mention', 'child', 'ensued', 'get', 'act', 'earlier']",14
so another piece of research has come out on the gender pay gap and yes women are still being paid less female managers are being paid over less than male counterparts doing the same job and on current trends womens pay will only catch up with mens in yes with pensions in the state they are most of us reading this will probably still be working in but id quite like pay equality before i hit years old so to hurry this along i have some suggestions for how women can achieve pay equality in doublequick speed womens strike can you imagine if all the women in the country went on strike at the same time well it might carry on relatively unperturbed but the health system would grind to a halt schools would be emptied newspapers would go unwritten and the lack of hairdressers would lead to the worst hair day this country had ever seen companies would be throwing money at women begging them to come back negotiate your pay when women start a new job they are more likely than men to take the bottom of the band starting salary rather than negotiate a higher wage on the basis of the skills and experience they are bringing to the job you know that snivelling dimwitted recent graduate who sits two seats away from you and gets his tie stuck in the photocopier he earns more than you because he asked for it and his dad runs the company enough boot your lack of selfesteem into next century and ask for more money look to hollywood get on to lovefilm right now and order working girl there we learn that the best way to get ahead in business is to break your bosss leg steal her boyfriend and go behind her back to set up a merger deal ok thats not a very good idea try to instead band together with female colleagues to terrorise your sexist boss until he gets abducted by an amazonian tribe the clothes might be awful but what a soundtrack suffragettes redux during the student protests people deplored the use of violence and vandalism for political ends yet looking back the suffragettes direct action seems almost quaint they chained themselves to railings aww they set fire to mailboxes haha they threw paint at priceless artwork snigger they detonated bombs oh hang on this redux version however will not be using bombs or frankly hunger strikes im not getting equal pay on an empty stomach a march of fierce women on downing street with sashes and demanding equal pay will still send ripples of fear through government especially if we barge into the house of commons and act more civilised than most of the members armwrestle for victory if it comes to it were not afraid to use it if youre not being paid as much as your male counterpart at work draw attention to this fact by demanding an armwrestle for the extra grand and dont presume that all men will

extramarital affairs are no longer the leading reason why couples decide to split up according to accountancy firm grant thorntons latest annual study of divorce in the uk instead growing apart is now the most popular motivation to file for divorce divorce lawyers interviewed by the firm said in of cases falling out of love had led to a marriage breakdown extramarital affairs which had been the prime reason since the survey began in fell to second place with citing this unreasonable behaviour was given as the reason for of marriage breakdowns and of couples cited a midlife crisis of course couples could be indulging in fewer flings but louisa plumb associate director forensic and investigation services at grant thornton suggested that as in so many areas of life celebrities could be a factor the movement in the reasons for divorce is interesting and certainly difficult to explain we are seeing an increasing number of celebrities putting up with alleged affairs in their marriage or relationship with abbey clancy staying with peter crouch and cheryl cole looking set to go back to ashley it may be that this is starting to have an effect on the behaviour of couples affected by extramarital affairs with more marriages than before surviving a bout of infidelity christine northam a counsellor working for the charity relate said she thought the change reflected a slight shift in peoples expectations of relationships she said while in the past an affair would have been the signal that all was not right in a relationship now that is not necessarily the case people are not necessarily having those affairs before they decide the spark has gone out of their relationship one thing most celebrities dont generally have to worry about is money but this was the reason cited by of divorcing couples despite the economic downturn and inflation putting pressure on household budgets that figure hasnt increased since last year but divorce lawyers believe couples have been influenced by the recession of those surveyed said they thought people had delayed divorce proceedings because of the recession with saying that the lack of value andor liquidity of personal assets was the greatest contributor to this delay however some lawyers said their clients had taken advantage of the economy and divorced during the recession in order to benefit from lower income and asset values and give their partner a lower settlement while the economy has officially been out of recession for over a year there are still clear indicators that financial concerns are one of the driving factors in both the timing of divorces and the settlements that have been awarded said plumbs colleague geoff mesher with cuts in public spending and the economy continuing to falter it would be unsurprising to see a continuation of this trend as asset values and income levels remain unpredictable david salter joint national head of family law at mills amp reeve dismissed the idea that footballers wives were behind any changes in couples behaviour but agreed the recession had made a difference the downturn is making people very wary about what is at the end of the day an elective purchase he said house prices have fallen terrifically where before you would have sold the house and bought two new homes that may not be possible any more assets are very difficult to value and

i probably shouldnt say too much im female you see and scientists have said that girls are at risk of talking too much it was a headline in the telegraph scary stuff if we ladies dont stop our nattering all human culture could be swept away by the chirruping tide of oestrogenimbued verbiage the headline fits with the old old stereotype about talkative women you can see it lurking in scathing epithets like nag shrew and fishwife and it comes out frequently in popular works of neurosexism such as louann brizendines the female brain but when linguist mark liberman tried to factcheck claims that women are the more voluble sex he found no evidence the scientific support for this picture of biological determinism seems to slip through the fingers as you try to grasp it he writes so before i clamp my scolds bridle in place maybe i should read the rest of the telegraph piece it turns out that this isnt really a story about how women communicate excessively instead its about how universities and academics communicate with the world and what journalists do with the information they receive the telegraph report is based on a paper thats due to be published in the journal child development well sort of it seems to be based on a press release based on the duetobepublished paper although it doesnt name the paper and it conflates the results with those of a previous study all of which falls short of the standards you might hope a national newspaper would apply to science reporting though that obviously wont surprise readers of ben goldacre the paper to which the telegraph report refers by professor amanda rose studies how girls and boys expect talking about problems will make them feel what it doesnt study i know this because professor rose was kind enough to send me a copy is whether girls are talking too much not enough or just the right amount and while the results show some gender differences girls are relatively more likely to expect that talking about problems will make them feel better boys are relatively more likely to expect that talking about problems will make them feel weird or be unproductive within the paper rose is careful to stress that the relationship between gender and problem talk is limited a concern is that overstating sex effects leads to stereotypical thinking about girls and boys she writes it should not be overlooked that girls and boys both endorsed positive expectations more strongly than negative expectations and in the spirit of not overstating sex effects the university of missouri produced a press release and rose confirms by email that she approved it with the title males believe discussing problems is a waste of time mu study shows in the transition from academic journal to attentiongrabbing press release the selfreported feelings of a minority of boys have been transformed into something thats generally true of males as a whole its almost as if no one was that concerned at all about overstating sex effects still professor rose was right that exaggerating gender differences could lead to reductive thinking as well as the telegraph report her research has spawned a comment piece in the philadelphia magazine called snappily housewives shut up rose offers some intelligent explanations in her paper of the way that cultural gender expectations go to inform childrens ideas about how they should behave but the way her paper has been promoted makes it part of the same determinist slurry what cordelia fine describes as recycling gender in her incredibly good book delusions of gender these stereotypical associations linger on writes fine continuing to be reinforced by the patterns of a halfchanged world the false belief that women talk excessively becomes a reason to tell them to talk less just as the headline in the telegraph does but it isnt girls who need to watch their words its the journalists prs and academics who allow tiresome preconceptions and hunger for publicity to distort the way they present science to the world,2011-08,probably shouldnt say much im female see scientist said girl risk talking much wa headline telegraph scary stuff lady dont stop nattering

after a good oldfashioned media blitz the term erotic capital coined by dr catherine hakim a sociologist at the london school of economics became the buzz phrase of the week hakims new book out on thursday is entitled honey money the power of erotic capital heres a quick refresher erotic capital is a combination of beauty social skills good dress sense physical fitness liveliness sex appeal and sexual competence and while it is exploitable by all hakim argues that women have more scope to do so seeing as men want sex more than women in an article titled attractive wins and ugly loses in todays rat race in the evening standard hakim explained the concept today the financial returns of attractiveness equal the returns of qualifications many young women now think beauty is just as important as education those who possess erotic capital have a big advantage she says these people smile at the world and find that the world smiles back and remembers them less inclined to smile was zoe williams in the guardian who had trouble with the underlying notion of a male sex deficit she wrote this area is culturally quite freighted there are certain expectations going back centuries of male sexuality being rampant and ungovernable and equal and opposite expectations of female sexuality this might call me crazy impact upon the way that men and women report express and prosecute their sexual desire yasmin alibhaibrown was equally unimpressed in the independent writing in sum her thesis men want sex more than do women after the age of that testosteronefuelled desperation needs to be mined and exploited and to do that females must become lifelong geishas ceaselessly prettify themselves and bargain cunningly with men she concludes this may mark the arrival of redtop sociology perhaps they should put hakim on celebrity big brother but hakim has a fan in daily telegraph writer bryony gordon who argues that the sociologist is absolutely right more than that her book should be read out to young girls as part of the national curriculum she adds i am sick of women feeling they have to do themselves down and wear their body issues as some badge of honour if thats feminism then count me out more support comes from sarah vine in the times who finds hakims attack on feminist sheila jeffreys refreshingly stern she writes it might appear that hakim is harking back to

in the aftermath of englands august riots a small number of girls have been brought before the court they have been lumped together by the media predictably described by their clothes and hair but the main thing they have in common is that they rioted and that they are girls why and how they participated in the riots will differ according to their circumstances sadly violence touches the lives of some girls and young women in their homes their schools their relationships their peer groups and on the streets some girls have to navigate violent landscapes each day depending on their backgrounds their contact with those who can help and their selfesteem or resilience that violence can impact some girls choices and outlook over the past five years i have worked with and interviewed hundreds of girls caught up in volatile and violent environments some have held firearms on behalf of boys others have attacked boys some say they are aggressive so that young men wont see them as sexual objects to be abused and attacked others because they want to make money but how many of these motivations are reflected in our response to their violence interventions for children who have committed offences are centred around why boys engage in or desist from offending the youth justice board reported earlier this year that in males were responsible for of all recorded offences committed by young people amid the commentary that girls are becoming increasingly violent the youth justice system has never been designed to respond to offending by young women from the assessment tools used to predict risk to the interventions designed to decrease vulnerability girls have been an afterthought if we really want to prevent offending and reoffending this needs to change taking a gendered approach to the youth justice system is not about making excuses for girls who offend or claiming that boys should be punished and girls should not we live in a gendered world girls experience the world as girls and the world responds to them in the same way their involvement in the riots is another example of this any response to girls who have committed offences needs to be able to recognise the gendered context within which these offences are committed i have lost count of the numbers who have said to me how do you think it was for me i was the only girl when recounting their experiences of being in the youth justice system where their needs were ignored while the involvement of girls in violence is documented we are yet to see a gendered consideration of what needs to happen at a policy level speculation about the impact on boys of being raised by single mothers has been plentiful for example but what is the impact on girls do we know how many girls are in single parent homes because of domestic violence and even when we can answer these questions we still need to know the impact of such circumstances on the girls who do commit violence and the majority who dont we cannot make sense of young womens involvement in violence until we can pick these issues apart we are starting to see progress only last month the allparty parliamentary group on women in the penal system announced that it would hold an independent inquiry into girls in the justice system such an inquiry will for the first time shine a light on the experiences of young women in a system designed for young men and make the case for a justice system relevant to girls the inquiry comes in a year when the government launched its action plan to end violence against women and girls and backed a plan to tackle child sexual exploitation addressing the victimisation and offending of young women is essential if we are to prevent their use of violence the recent riots have reawakened the public consciousness to the impact that violence can have on our lives now is the time to harness this interest and fear to create a more effective criminal justice system violence damages lives in different

rape statistics are notoriously difficult to use in a way that is considered fair and reasonable by all even last years report by baroness stern commissioned by the government to look into concerns over the level of rape cases resulting in convictions failed to settle all the issues around statistics for some campaigners a reader who was looking at the guardians archive found two historic articles published on march and march with which he took strong issue both articles used the same pair of statistics in the same way turning to the first this was the sentence that led to the complaint of the rapes that were reported from to only resulted in a conviction compared with of criminal cases in general the reader said this is wrong on both counts about of reported rapes result in a conviction not and you have in fact pointed out this mistake several times in your corrections and clarifications column more importantly the suggestion that of general criminal cases result in a conviction is just nonsense only about of reports of general criminal cases result in someone being charged let alone convicted i would imagine that the percentage of reports that actually result in a conviction is in single figures and it is certainly less than that for rape given the frequency with which these articles are referred to it would make sense for your paper to attach corrections to them in order to avoid readers picking up entirely false ideas about conviction rates dealing with the first figure of it is indeed true to say that we have corrected the usage of this figure in the past but it is a little more complicated than that as some work by my colleague leslie plommer nearly two years ago which became a guardian editorial guidance note reveals the formulation that is correct and should be our standard is in england and wales about of reported rapes end in a conviction we could elaborate that is conviction on a range of charges from rape to lesser offences such as sexual assault and others the body of evidence for the is far from extensive but it is the finding of the most authoritative and up to date study commissioned by the home office on what the outcomes are for reported rapes what about the conviction rate we often cite eg only of reported rapes end in a conviction certainly we are free to use the but have to signal clearly that this represents a narrower body of convictions those on the charge of rape itself the reference to of criminal cases in general is wrong and results from misreading a sentence in a press release from the solicitor generals office on october that stated overall only of rapes reported to the police result in a conviction however of all cases prosecuted result in a conviction the highest conviction rate for years this refers to of rape cases that are prosecuted not general criminal cases although it is interesting to note that in the solicitor general was using the figure of around for rape convictions however the guardian will continue to use the figure of as the benchmark which is much closer to the recommended by the stern report the real problem is finding a meaningful comparison for rape convictions there are no home office figures under the heading general criminal convictions but even if they existed they would take in crimes such as burglary and criminal damage where the victim largely never sees or is not aware of the perpetrator unlike rape figures for rape as measured against those for violence against the person seem a much more relevant comparison among the statistics collated by the home office are the sanctiondetection rates these are defined as the percentage of crimes for which someone is charged summonsed and receives a caution or other formal sanction the home office statistics show that the sanction detection rate for violence against the person was and for rape,2011-08,rape statistic notoriously difficult use way considered fair reasonable even last year report

there are women missing from britains most powerful jobs they should be in parliament in the cabinet and running big companies and major public sector organisations at the current rate of progress it will be another years before there is equal representation of women in parliament and on the boards of ftse companies gender equality makes periodic leaps forward and then slows to a glacial pace for a few decades it sprints in some areas and remains stubbornly stuck in others now we are fast moving into a strange paradox in which the numbers of women overtake men in entering further education and many professions women are set to make up a majority of doctors by but men still overtake them to reach the top its a rum state of affairs when the most powerful are selected from an ever smaller section of the workforce leaving to waste the huge investment in womens skills time for a reckoning its roughly my generation that is failing to break through into the top jobs women in their s and s who could now be running the country but arent according to the equality and human rights commissions report sex and power its analysis is that its a case of discrimination direct and indirect motherhood and domestic responsibilities still exact a steep penalty i feel like im back on the school hockey pitch i was useless with my pe teacher urging me to make a bit more of an effort and get stuck in well before we creep off the pitch with a chronic sense of failure its cheering to remember what this generation has achieved twenty five years ago parttime work in professional occupations was virtually unheard of there was only one model of female career success and it consciously aimed to emulate a driven obsessive male version it was the era of shoulder pads and cliches of ballcrunching women bosses since then the workplace has been revolutionised with a huge increase in the number of women working parttime working mothers are no longer a novelty and fathering no longer part of a hidden private life in most offices slipping the christmas nativity play or a teacher meeting into a busy day is routine the importance of family life and the necessity of flexibility for childcare have become part of office culture women bosses have escaped ludicrous stereotypes to become normal thats quite an achievement something i never dreamed would be possible when i had my first child and was back at the desk fulltime within four months of her birth now i look at colleagues routinely taking a years maternity leave and returning parttime but its two steps forward one step back the labour market has segregated into one for mums and one for serious players mums look for cosy niches jobs they can manage without too much strain on the family for which they still take the bulk of responsibility when men take on the primarycarer role and go parttime it can play a crucial role in helping women to reach the top but change here inches forward the gender roles around caring and breadwinning have proved resistant to change perhaps we should be less surprised or frustrated that this kind of social change can take time we have been a transitional generation trying to live up to our stayathome mothers standards of availability and attention while also carving out careers equally men have sought to emulate their fathers career dedication while responding to new expectations of engaged parenting its hardly surprising the concept of role strain litters the research studies its not just the infamous homemade mince pies for the school fete bought and bashed about with a rolling pin at midnight to look homemade in allison pearsons novel i dont know how she does it but now new communication technologies require instantaneous multitasking a child texting that they are locked

it but it requires ferocious organisation focus and energy lots dont have them or dont even want them i know many women my age who could be among those missing at the top instead of becoming chief

catherine hakim is a sociologist at the london school of economics who has written a book called honey money the world smiles at goodlooking people and they smile back is its subtitle and it goes on to posit this theory that we have erotic capital and this divides into six categories beauty sexual attractiveness social skills like grace charm and discreet flirtation liveliness which is a mixture of physical fitness social energy and good humour social presentation including dress jewellery and other adornments and finally sexuality itself competence energy imagination we meet in covent garden over fancy tapas she arrives and says i must go and brush my hair which she really neednt have done because i dont buy her theory i dont care what someones hair looks like i find hair neither impedes nor accelerates a discussion about ideas i did not say so thank god even in jest otherwise our encounter could have been even worse than it was erotic capital according to the book can be used by women and men but as a result of the male sex deficit men want sex much more than women a new social fact that social scientists have mostly sidestepped women have more scope to exploit it in sexualised individualised modern societies she writes erotic capital is becoming more important and more valorised for men and women however women have a longer tradition of developing and exploiting it and yet for all our noble history of accessorising and being lively we have never as a sex been encouraged to exploit it because of the patriarchy patriarchal ideologies have systematically trivialised womens erotic capital to discourage women from capitalising on it at mens expense furthermore unfortunately radical feminists today reinforce patriarchal moral objections to the deployment of erotic capital and one reason why erotic capital has been overlooked is that the elite cannot monopolise it so it is in their interest to belittle it and sideline it hakim is keen to stress that her thesis is evidence based and nothing to do with prejudice or ideology and finishes her introduction with this rallying cry why not champion femininity rather than abolish it why does no one encourage women to exploit men whenever they can anyway shes back her hair looks great she sits down the tables are quite close together and we start talking about this sex deficit she has presented a wealth of studies that show men want to get laid more within their relationship that celibacy is far more common among women that masturbation and use of erotic material are far more common among men that men are more unfaithful and more frustrated report more sexual desire across a whole range of countries the only thing i think might complicate her conclusion that men are randier than women and why wont we all just accept it is that this area is culturally quite freighted there are certain expectations going back centuries of male sexuality being rampant and ungovernable and equal and opposite expectations of female sexuality this might call me crazy impact upon the way that men and women report express and prosecute their sexual desire there are lesser issues on the same spectrum like for instance that women are underrepresented in the making of pornography so might be underrepresented in the consumption of it without this necessarily leading to the conclusion that were not interested in sex in the book she dismisses the idea of ones response to porn being determined by whether your sex is represented as the spectator or the object as nonsensical my alternative view is supported by hakims finding that in the absence of distorting social constraints there appear to be no sex differences in sexual interest among younger people up to around the age of her conclusion that women lose interest after theyve had kids because their attention has switched to childrearing could conceivably be countered by the idea that the women under in these sex surveys being younger might have evolved further from the social constraints that might colour the answers of older women its just a thought the majority of the studies come from the early s she mentions smaller repeat studies in britain that occurred this century but the only reference is reported in medical journals the finnish and australian studies were conducted this century but most of the time where there is a st century reference on closer inspection it turns out to be about some other element of sex only tangentially related to the male sex deficit pricing in prostitution the thoughts of a blogger who likes to shag a lot whose inclusion marks a new weird point in the art of indexing some figures on sexless marriages which could just as easily demonstrate both parties would like to have sex just not with each other in short a large part of her supporting evidence is years old and since by her own admission different ages give different readings it strikes me that this picture of the horny male and the frigid babysitting female might not be the end of the story so i ask her very mildly i swear whether or not she thinks that women might when they talk about their sexuality still be labouring under a bit of cultural baggage immediately she starts barking at me she tells me im using valueladen language and that ive got to get over the idea that people cant change look at muslims they turn against their cultural expectations within one generation of arriving here the people on the next table to us get up and move i would argue that its a lot easier to get over cultural expectation when you have the warm bath of a different culture that you live in ready to step into but i dont say any of that because im worried that one or both of the people who have just moved might be muslims and theres always a chance she might start barking again so instead i just accept the sex deficit as fact lets talk about something else she writes in societies and periods when women have limited access to economic social and human capital erotic capital is crucial for them which may be why women have traditionally worked harder at it possibly then as womens capital in those other areas increases their reliance on erotic capital should fall she rolls her eyes as if she cannot believe shes suffering the indignity of such a foolish conversation should she exclaims im being an anglosaxon puritan she really doesnt have my number at all but no matter shes not here to interview me i didnt mean should as in ought to for some moral puritanical reason i meant one might reasonably assume like if cloud cover correlates with rainfall when clouds dissipate rainfall should decrease but never mind our food is going cold i feel a bit sick to be honest the waitress looks to me to be too scared to come and take it away i accept or at least i stop arguing that whatever a womans economic agency and position in society she should still make a big fandango about her sexual playfulness and exquisite taste in shoes lets talk a bit about those six elements of erotic capital i ask whether or not all of them are indivisible from sex on some level people like flirtatiousness because it conveys some possibility its not just a coquettish renaissance thing that you do for politeness like holding open a door she fixes me with an angry eye now we finally come down to it im surprised its taken so long she sounds a little bit like darth vader you understand erotic capital as sexual capital im saying no i say no several times in the book facial beauty is not about sexuality sex appeal yes is about sexuality sexual competence yes is about sexuality but physical liveliness being able to tell jokes that is not about sexuality dress sense ability to present yourself these are not about sexuality but surely you know from your life that these things that make you attracted to someone sexually are exactly the things you describe you know liveliness is part of it in a work setting and in a whole lot of other social settings someone who is lively is attractive without necessarily being sexually attractive someone who dances well is attractive to look at even if you dont particularly want to have sex with them im saying that there are six elements of which only one is purely sexual and the second one sex appeal is only partly to do with sex four of them have nothing to do with sexual attraction there are several theorists whom i note and mention who think the only thing that matters is sexual capital the only thing that matters is sexual attractiveness they happen to be gay in the gay community this is absolutely the case the gay community is not interested in talk not interested in getting to know you its interested in sex in a much more straightforward and simple way well of course a homophobic rant is always an unexpected treat on a monday lunchtime hang on a sec gay people dont choose partners on the basis of their personality im simply reporting what i have read and been told by people who know more about this and have written more about it than i have and im simply saying that sociality features less strongly in the gay community you just said the gay community is not interested in talk i think that needs a little more flesh on its bones im not going to go into the gay community you want to trip me up you are trying to trip me up all the time well this distracted me otherwise i would have had a number of followup questions like for instance in what regard is sex appeal only partly to do with sex and if none of the others have anything to do with sex in what regard are they erotic how does it differ from just having a personality we move on to china she seems to view their appraisal of erotic capital quite positively the paper im particularly interested in was a study limited to women in shanghai that said there were much higher returns double the level in north america to looking attractive and the second thing was that attractiveness was definitely related to expenditure on clothing and cosmetics i ask whether its her view that china takes a more honest approach to attractiveness and its place in the economy you keep using these valueladen words i dont understand the language you use perhaps youd like to rephrase your question in a nonvalueladen way ok you did say earlier that you thought china was normal and north america was abnormal that you thought the american response to erotic capital had been perverted by puritanism so perhaps you could expand a bit upon that i think its true generally of anglosaxon puritan cultures and that includes britain and the rest of the world values erotic capital and therefore you might say it was normal rather than abnormal abnormality is the anglosaxon response the research evidence is from britain and america so its difficult to generalise from so tell me a bit about how the puritan hegemony came about in anglosaxon cultures well i think it has a lot to do with christianity you dont think islam has had just as much an effect on prudishness she starts to speak very slowly i believe shes attempting to convey that i am the stupidest person shes ever met no because islam is not common in puritan cultures in fact they are abominated by christianity for the last years yes i understand that i am asking if christianity managed to imbue anglosaxon cultures with this prudishness why did the moral strictures of any other religious system not imbue their cultures more sighing puritanism doesnt arise in others its a christian sect its a christian development well a huge amount of sexual restrictiveness arises in other religions but you dont think that has had any impact on their surrounding cultures i havent written a book about sexual activity and sexual cultures outside the western world but it strikes me that youre basically saying america and britain and anybody else with an anglosaxon belief structure their course has been perverted so theyve arrived at a position that is wrong and that is the result of christianity im interested if that is what you mean in why christianity should be the only religion to pervert the course of culture when all religions well most religions have militant sexually illiberal factions that i dont know ask people who are specialists in religion im not a specialist in religion you cant use christianity as your rationale and then refuse to engage in why it would exert so singular an influence im not using it as a rationale im saying fact it is a fact that the countries where christianity holds sway have had a down on sexuality pleasure and things to do with the body its there in the literature people who know more about this than i do have said so do you think the reason we dont allow women to capitalise on their erotic resources is because we disapprove of sex sorry who is disapproving of sex anglosaxon cultures i dont think i say that anywhere you just did actually she also says it in her book the puritan ethic did a lot more than promote capitalism it seems to have ruined sex for a lot of people in the western world evidence base that id like to see i dont think ive read anywhere that people disapprove of sex there is a generally negative attitude in the puritan christian culture toward pleasure sexuality aesthetic enjoyment things that are not purely of the mind yet again we are not getting anywhere she disowns her views then restates them with abandon she gets incredibly cross i am slightly too old to capitulate just because someone is unpleasant to me this you might call my unerotic capital we have a number of other skirmishes about berlusconi jordan david beckham christine lagarde rebekah brooks and children in her book she lays into a number of feminists saving her peculiar dismissiveness for anglosaxon feminism french and german feminists reject anglosaxon victim feminism in all its guises she writes i ask in the spirit of genuine interest who she means by french and german feminists since it would seem to be pertinent whether shes talking about elisabeth badinter or virginie despentes catherine millet or julia kristeva she reacts with disgust to the question you keep asking me for names im not going to give you names as if im asking for tittletattle in the book it turns out she is referring to badinter so its weird that she wont discuss her and to luce irigaray who is actually belgian but lets not be pedantic or at least this statement of hers what we need for our future civilisation for human maturity is a sexed culture no serious reader of irigaray would take this to mean she supported erotic capital irigaray described her own career thus a first phase in which i showed how a single subject traditionally the masculine subject had constructed the world according to a single perspective a second phase in which she defined those mediations that could permit the existence of a feminine subjectivity that is to say another subject and the third she sees as trying to define a new model of possible relations between man and woman without submission of either one to the other broadly then and at a much more theoretical level irigaray fashioned the point that hakim earlier described as nonsensical in relation to porn that the two sexes could not be judged and discussed and measured within parameters that had been framed by only one of those sexes i mean look its quite an intricate point of academic feminism you dont have to agree or disagree with it but it has sod all to do with hakims social science and the idea that it constitutes a rejection of anglosaxon victim feminism is a basic misunderstanding elsewhere the comparisons are sloppy some of the most taboobreaking and positive books about female sexuality were written by french women the story of o the diary of anas nin these texts form a sharp contrast with equivalent moralising novels by englishmen such as moll flanders and vanity fair except that the first was published by a woman in and the second was published by a woman in whereas those equivalent moralising novels were published by men respectively in and sharp contrast you might just as well find a sharp contrast between the sexual standards in shakespeare and the venerable bede after the interview hakim rang the editor posing two questions was it my idea to interview her or the desks and was i in the middle of a marital breakdown clearly shed cooked up a dark motive whereby my husband was ditching me for someone with superior erotic capital and id tracked her down with the direct purpose of disagreeing with her this tickled me if i were a spurned ex seeking revenge i would definitely not do it via a social scientist and if i were to do it via a social scientist id choose one with a bit more going on honey money by catherine hakim is published by allen lane at to order a copy for visit the guardian bookshopcatherine hakim will be discussing

when i was approached to take part in the womens aid real man campaign i thought that it was a simple way to get an important message maximum exposure i want to encourage men to get involved in some way whether it is wearing the tshirt or just finding out more about it i have four sisters and with my mum and nieces as well there are a lot of women in the family so it feels important to look after them the thought of any of them being hurt makes me feel sick inside domestic violence is something that affected someone close to me and what it did to that person was awful how she found herself in that situation was really hard for me to take as she is such a strong woman but it made me realise that it can happen to anyone no matter how strong you are sometimes the amount that you love someone can outweigh the parameters of what is ok behaviour most men will say that its not acceptable and theres nothing smart about it but it still goes on i think changing this has a lot of to do with upbringing and role models as well as constantly reminding people that it is not something that will be forgotten or go ignored people will have different opinions as to what a real man actually is in my view it is someone who is honest with himself and others and does the right thing if someone is suffering abuse you need to offer support and let them know that theyre not the only person thats been in this situation and that there are people who are willing to help them be it yourself or organisations such as womens aid im not sure if i would call myself a feminist i just know that i respect women and thats the most important thing to me,2011-08,wa approached take part womens aid real man campaign thought wa simple way get important message maximum exposure want encourage men get involved way whether wearing tshirt finding four sister mum niece well lot woman family feel important look thought hurt make feel sick inside domestic violence something affected someone close person wa awful found situation wa really hard take strong woman made realise happen anyone matter strong sometimes amount love someone outweigh parameter ok behaviour men say acceptable nothing smart still go think changing ha lot upbringing role model well constantly reminding people something forgotten go ignored people different opinion real man actually view someone honest others doe right thing someone suffering abuse need offer support let know theyre person thats situation people willing help organisation womens aid im sure would call feminist know respect woman thats important thing,"['wa', 'approached', 'take', 'part', 'womens', 'aid', 'real', 'man', 'campaign', 'thought', 'wa', 'simple', 'way', 'get', 'important', 'message', 'maximum', 'exposure', 'want', 'encourage', 'men', 'get', 'involved', 'way', 'whether', 'wearing', 'tshirt', 'finding', 'four', 'sister', 'mum', 'niece', 'well', 'lot', 'woman', 'family', 'feel', 'important', 'look', 'thought', 'hurt', 'make', 'feel', 'sick', 'inside', 'domestic', 'violence', 'something', 'affected', 'someone', 'close', 'person', 'wa', 'awful', 'found', 'situation', 'wa', 'really', 'hard', 'take', 'strong', 'woman', 'made', 'realise', 'happen', 'anyone', 'matter', 'strong', 'sometimes', 'amount', 'love', 'someone', 'outweigh', 'parameter', 'ok', 'behaviour', 'men', 'say', 'acceptable', 'nothing', 'smart', 'still', 'go', 'think', 'changing', 'ha', 'lot', 'upbringing', 'role', 'model', 'well', 'constantly', 'reminding', 'people', 'something', 'forgotten', 'go', 'ignored', 'people', 'different', 'opinion', 'real', 'man', 'actually', 'view', 'someone', 'honest', 'others', 'doe', 'right', 'thing', 'someone', 'suffering', 'abuse', 'need', 'offer', 'support', 'let', 'know', 'theyre', 'person', 'thats', 'situation', 'people', 'willing', 'help', 'organisation', 'womens', 'aid', 'im', 'sure', 'would', 'call', 'feminist', 'know', 'respect', 'woman', 'thats', 'important', 'thing']",14
schools out for activists as they graduated yesterday from uk feministas second summer school with interest in feminism sparking across the uk this weekends suffragette school in birmingham aimed to equip budding activists with a toolbox of techniques for building a feminist future with attacks on abortion rights the relentless objectification of women in the media and the assault on womens economic independence through public sector cuts theres certainly no shortage of obstacles to creating it hence lessons at summer school included everything from suffragetteera tactics of direct action to the rather more modern approach of mobilising the masses through facebook and twitter teachers included karak mayik women for women internationals country director for south sudan speaking live via skype from the worlds newest nation karak described the challenges womens rights activists there face after decades of conflict and how despite brutal poverty and high hivrates they are still managing to bring about monumental changes in womens daily lives back in birmingham uk uncut activist aisha mirza shared strategies for fighting the cuts which include making origami swans inside fortnum amp mason and filling banks with babies object campaigner anna van heeswijk revealed how activists are embodying the ideal that a revolution without dancing is not a revolution worth having with the novel approach of doing the conga round tesco important questions were also asked about the future of feminism with womens lives being so diverse and the impact of sexism refracted by the many aspects of their identity class race sexuality and disability how can we work to ensure the strategies and solutions reflect this and given that bringing about real progress will also mean fundamentally changing what it means to be a man in this society how do we mobilise men and boys to escape the masculinity trap those conversations and the search for solutions need to continue because feminism is a movement not a club everyone has a vital part to play in it a key principle emerging from activist communities across the uk and embedded in the summer school is that this is a movement that neither has nor needs leaders the feminist resurgence is following the trajectory that the second wave took which according to gloria steinem happened not so much by organisation as contagion activists across the uk are organising autonomously and deciding their own agenda why because no one person can lay claim to knowledge of what the one priority or single best tactic is because they dont exist the issues confronting feminists are so complex and wideranging that autonomous organising on multiple fronts and in multiple ways is the only approach that stands a chance feminism is returning to the streets and thats where it belongs progress towards a world where women and men live equally wont be achieved solely by small groups of policymakers behind closed doors it takes ordinary women and men to stand up and make their voices heard it requires people to believe in an alternative and imagine a world where women and men are equal over the coming year well see summer school graduates and activists across the uk stencilling that world on billboards describing it in meeting rooms and holding up directions to it on placards as they march through the streets

without feminism gay rights would not exist britains homosexuals would be imprisoned married or dead but there is a homophobic lie so often repeated by feminists and female columnists that it has become an accepted truism that the wests obsession with skinniness with size zero and the crisis of selfimage that follows is the fault of gays gay fashion designers want emaciated models it is said because they want women to look more boyish they want women to look like young men devoid of curves this was a line rehearsed in the observer it has long been said that fashion is a contrick by largely gay male designers to make women look more like men breastless hipless as skinny as a boy vogue is not a magazine for children and in the daily mail a similar line was peddled earlier this year the elite of mostly gay designers has been creating catwalk designs for prepubescent teenagers and each year wanting models who looked less and less like women the designers were wanting women to look more and more like young men this theory has never been challenged becoming the sole socially acceptable line in homophobic thought but it is not acceptable it is simply bile hawked up from the darkest cavity of feminisms lungs why then is the argument such pernicious nonsense implicit in the belief that gay designers want women to look more boyish is the notion that gay men are only capable of finding beauty in the masculine that by making women more androgynous they become more alluring gay men are aroused by boyishness rather than manliness these are all untrue if you think gay men only have an aesthetic appreciation of either the androgynous or the male you need only turn to art created by gay men michelangelos piet or caravaggios the penitent magdalene or you could note the adoration of womanly women in contemporary gay mens musical tastes beyonc anyone no matter how masculine or boyish as the rhetoric would have it a woman looked a gay designer would never find her sexually attractive so why we must ask would they purposefully mould women in the alleged fashion what would be the point in short gay men are attracted to men not boys to blur this line is to perpetuate the most poisonous of homophobic slurs that gay men are all paedophiles and so we come to the real reason for fashion slashing womens curves commerce this isnt so much a patriarchal conspiracy as a capitalist one the way to extract money from someone is to encourage fear and the desire to control fear causes us to buy that which prevents social rejection to be ahead of the joneses deodorant the latest cut of jeans the constantly upgrading gadgets and controlling tendencies lure us to products that shape ourselves and our environment the ajax the ambi pur plugins the liposuction a thin control freak is fashions ultimate customer which brings us back to clothes the history of fashion contradicts those who repeat the gay designer slur coco chanel introduced the more boyish look the structured straightupanddown silhouette ignoring the hourglass it was women who made trousers the archetypal male attire fashionable marlene dietrich and katherine hepburn and it was a heterosexual male designer andr courrges who first brought long trousers to womenswear in the early s today which designer is most routinely feted for his celebration of the womanly shape roland mouret the gay creator of the galaxy dress when journalists speak of an industry dominated by gay men they ignore both the plethora of female designers stella mccartney sarah burton vivienne westwood donatella versace amanda wakeley luella bartley and more and the commercially huge straight men such as ralph lauren and tommy hilfiger they ignore too the immense power of predominantly female fashion editors gaultier and lagerfeld dont control fashion anna wintour does this antigay theory this splutter of lazy baseless thought born out of justifiable despair at body fascism deserves to die

divorce is never easy even in the privileged circles of southern california it is a traumatic and costly experience there are lawyers to pay prenuptial agreements to regret and houses to sell as once comfortable lives prepare to undergo a transformation that is where jill alexander steps in alexander has sparked a craze for divorce parties among wellheeled divorcees who are looking to offload the baggage of their married lives her new company the divorcee sale organises events where newly divorced women can sell their clothes jewellery and handbags at bargain prices held in hotel ballrooms and chic event spaces across the los angeles area the sales have become a huge smash i just knew it would work divorce is pretty common these days and people are looking to offload their stuff alexander told the observer she sees huge potential for the divorcee sale across america and the rest of the world divorce doesnt just happen in southern california she said it will be my way of turning a negative into a positive it seems a winwin situation the women get a windfall just when they need it customers get knockdown prices and alexander takes her cut a percentage of the proceeds goes to various charities certainly the items on offer are attractive and at prices which mean everyone from the rich to the budgetconscious can find a bargain recent sales have included a poncho by dior a snip at and a pair of tory burch shoes for just other brand names included prada louis vuitton and dolce amp gabbana but alexander who perhaps tellingly is a little wary of marriage these days says that the main aim is not to create a business it is to help a woman get through a difficult period of her life while the money the sales produce is important it is the psychological lift of shedding the trappings of a previous life that can be most important it is a really cathartic experience when you clear out your closet it can be freeing you are downsizing but you also dont want the clothes from your past life said the former fashion manager one of alexanders clients internet and radio executive julie spira has blogged about her experience of a sale alexander came to her house and helped her examine her closet it felt like the scene in the sex and the city movie where carrie and her friends collectively decided on what she would keep as her life was moving forward with big spira wrote business is certainly booming the divorcee sale will hold its first event outside southern california next month when alexander hosts a threeday sale in new york a space has already been booked in the

prices it is going to be great we are expecting an offthecharts weekend alexander said nor is it likely to stop there so far alexanders only disappointment is failing to attract any celebrities to the cause i thought the celebrities would come but they have not shown up yet she said perhaps imageaware stars are still a little wary of being associated with divorce despite its prevalence in hollywood

feminism the pessimists say is over drowned in a froth of pink tulle and buried with a stiletto heel through its heart for those who have struggled to measure its success by its victories in equal pay and boardroom jobs progress has been dishearteningly slow the forces of darkness never seem far away ready to berate the feckless undermining of the patriarchy or to mock the reluctance of women to fight their way to the top as honorary men feminists have had their chance and it turned out no one wanted what they were selling next weekends sellout uk feminista summer school should make the gloating critics reconsider there is a resurgence in feminist activism driven partly by a new appetite for direct action from demonstrations like the slutwalks earlier this summer to flash protests like last months eff off heff against the new playboy club in london campaigns against the pink princess phenomenon have made shops like the early learning centre think more carefully about how they sell their stuff grabbing headlines is important it inspires and makes people think but it can only ever be a part of the strategy its no good entertaining the movements extroverts if you cannot deliver a result its worse if it reinforces the old slur about hairylegged manhaters that left a generation of women embarrassed to say they were feminists below the horizon though there is something else going on that is not only about women fighting on traditional womens issues other newmodel organisations like london citizens or nhs direct action are finding that the way they do things encourages women to emerge as leaders working in intimate groups on issues like the living wage with horizontal rather than topdown communication makes it easier for women to contribute but change is hard and slow it needs the kind of momentum that comes from outrage but it also takes someone to do the hard grind to focus on the analysis and provide the ammunition the fawcett society part of the struggle for nearly years has made the running since the budget by taking the government to court for failing to consider the impact of cuts on women and at westminster there is proof that slowburn campaigns make a difference too labours determination to raise the number of women mps forced the tories to act in the end the result at last is an intake of women that although it is still less than

have a prenuptial agreement this may be the last thing on your mind while youre planning your lavish honeymoon to the bahamas but it is the most practical solution if theres a significant gap between the wealth of the bride and groom although in scotland the prenup is a contract in england it is not legally binding meaning that english courts have the power to overrule it however the uk supreme courts decision to uphold the prenup in the case between german heiress katrin radmacher and her husband nicholas granatino last year suggests that they may be recognised in the future not having a prenup but if you decide not to go for a prenuptial agreement but have significantly more money than your spouse it makes sense to keep the money as separate as possible rather than mixing it with matrimonial funds that way if the marriage ends the money you kept separate at the time of marriage has a better chance of being protected than money that has been put into joint funds sorting out the wedding venue with some places costing up to to hire for the big day you need to make sure you have a legally binding contact with the venue or supplier so that they and you know exactly what is being provided many people choose to have an informal arrangement with their supplier but this can lead to unexpected costs or worse being stood up by your venue before youve even reached the altar get properly hitched abroad when mick jagger and jerry hall were getting a divorce they found out that they were not actually married in the first place they like an increasing number of people went abroad for their wedding day and had a hindu wedding in bali however their marriage was not legally valid under indonesian law meaning that it was not recognised under english law either avoid confusion and embarrassment by making sure you comply with the necessary requirements and red tape of the country you are travelling to whos getting the wedding gifts parents often give gifts to their children on marriage gifts of up to by each parent are free of inheritance tax regardless of whether the parent survives seven years and grandparents can gift each tax free if parents are giving larger gifts they should consider whether this should go to both child and spouse although it may seem mean to only give a present to their daughter and not their soninlaw if the marriage comes to an end the soninlaw may end up with an expensive gift the parents would rather he didnt have dont let your marriage be taxing married couples can transfer assets between them free of capital gains tax and in some circumstances it may be sensible to consider transferring incomeproducing assets to make the most of this allowance beware though in scotland if an asset owned by one party premarriage is transferred to a spouse it will become matrimonial property and therefore subject to a claim on divorce this may also affect the outcome of a divorce in england home is where the heart is buying a property together is one of the most exciting things to do as a married couple but one must consider how to set up ownership you can own the property as joint tenants or as tenantsincommon in a joint tenancy the partners own the whole property and do not have a particular share in it while tenantsincommon each have a definite share in the property as joint tenants if one spouse dies than the property will automatically go to the other spouse but owning the property as tenantsincommon means that the will dictates who gets the property meaning that the spouse may not automatically receive it investing in your children sooner or later you may hear the pitter patter of tiny footsteps which means a future of childcare schooling and even university costs once you have kids you could set up a family partnership to allow parents or grandparents to pass wealth to your children while still retaining a degree of control over the money until the child reaches an age when they can control their own finances there is also the opportunity for adults to put money into personal or stakeholder pensions on behalf of their children plan your pension sorting out your pension is probably the least exciting thing to be doing when you get married but with changes currently being made to public sector pensions and people working for longer its becoming more and more important to sort your pension out at the earliest opportunity you dont want to get to your fifties having paid off most of your mortgage but with no money for your retirement til death do us part the will would you rather write your will yourself or have the government do it for you this was businessman and presenter sir gerry robinsons question to the estimated of the uk population who currently dont have wills although its a morbid thought for any newly weds it makes sense to plan for all eventualities people often assume their spouse will automatically inherit everything but that is not the case having a will drawn up is inexpensive and can save a great deal of heartache and confusion further down the line as told to nalini sivathasan,2011-08,prenuptial agreement may last thing mind youre planning

there is a debate taking place in the labour party about men and womens relationships diane abbott has pitched into it criticising blue labour and accusing me of saying that all that women need is a faithful man ive never said this but im sure that most women do want a faithful husband or partner and men want much the same thing from women love understanding friendship kindness and a relationship that is reciprocal but love and intimacy are tangled up in the power relations between men and women and there is a darker side to relationships between the sexes feminism has cast a powerful light on mens sexual violence on our masculinity and on mens domination of women when women assert their independence mens sense of self and identity can be threatened but this is not the whole story many men welcome womens equality and they support feminism because it has provided an opportunity to talk about relationships masculinity fatherhood emotional life and sexuality it has helped modern men to become more involved in the ordinary love of family life and relationships in the past labours tradition was about men and mens work it was a patriarchal culture that was reticent about emotions and marginalised women but it gave workingclass men pride in their work and in their union and it gave this pride a politics it gave the working class men and women a democratic voice at the table of government the temperance movement and the chapels strengthened it with the virtues of justice prudence temperance and courage and these virtues were not confined to labour politics men gave their active support to the suffragettes a few enduring imprisonment their motives were both radical and conservative as victor duval the founder of the mens political union for womens enfranchisement argued what was needed was some good men some honest men some real men today labours tradition of masculine solidarity is out of place in our more democratic culture of the sexes in the past three decades many mens lives have been irrevocably changed particularly men who have lost their work because of deindustrialisation mens incomes have stagnated and the old family wage has disappeared for increasing numbers of both workingclass and middleclass men the traditional role of family breadwinner and head of household is unattainable low wages and a lack of affordable housing have made it increasingly difficult for many young men to create an independent life of their own the traditional rites of passage into adulthood leaving home entering employment establishing a family and taking on legal obligations and rights are disappearing the balance of power between men and women has shifted within many families this has led to better and more equal relationships between men and women but it has also created a reaction from men and from women too against the greater equalisation of the sexes the loss of mens traditional masculine identities and the status and authority skilled work gave to many has fed into a xenophobic antiimmigration nationalist politics its virulence across europe has undermined support for traditional social democratic parties labour has to find new ways of speaking to men as workers husbands and particularly as fathers women need the support of their partners and husbands in looking after the children and in managing the household they need mens support in helping them succeed in the public world of work and politics in turn men need women to help them particularly in meeting the challenges of the changing emotional cultures of work parenting and relationships labour needs to help create a new democratic settlement between men and women a public life of equality and respect and a family life which is a shared endeavour of bringing up children it would require a familyfriendly economy a living wage equal pay for women skills training flexible and secure employment and affordable homes so that mothers and fathers have more opportunity to negotiate work housework child care and free time emotional life lies at the heart of the bonds that bind people and society together and politics has to be attuned to them or fail labours debate

rarely can there have been a group of voters who swung so far so fast polls suggest the drop in womens support for the conservative party has been dramatic since the election the quiet crisis ed miliband describes as affecting families across the country is hitting women hardest and the government knows it as the downing street memo uncovered by this paper confirms they have a problem but the pressures and politics of womens lives create three important challenges for labour too first we need to stand side by side with women against the onslaught on childcare womens pensions and womens jobs to stop the government turning the clock back there is no doubt that women are being harder hit by the coalition independent research shows that women are paying more than twice as much in tax and benefit changes not least because of the scale of cuts to family support according to aviva women have stopped work in the last year because they cannot afford childcare meanwhile over half a million women in their s are paying the heaviest penalty for the governments changes to the pension age losing an average of as a result labour must continue to campaign hard to stop the government undermining the progress that has been made for women after all these policies are about much more than a bit of cash in their pockets at the end of the month for the grandma forced to ditch her plans to retire and move closer to her grandchildren its about precious family relationships for the woman forced to give up work because she cant pay for childcare its about her financial independence and sense of identity secondly we need to show how the governments weakness on women exposes fundamental flaws in their entire ideology david cameron and nick clegg cannot be allowed to get away with a blind spot about more than half the population underlying their policies is a toxic approach which is not just bad for women small state tories and libertarian liberals believe the public sector shouldnt support the family because it creates dependency even though many women know that progress by labour on things like tax credits and quality childcare shamefully dismissed as wasted years by the lib dems last week is what gives them independence opportunities and choices at the same time traditional tories think only traditional families should get support hence the plans for the universal credit which penalises women who work more than a few hours a week be it the liberal or the traditional philosophy women lose out but so too do families men communities and the economy thirdly we need to face up to the tougher political truth that many of the women who are now angry at the coalition backed the tories or lib dems rather than labour in the general election women in their s were still much more likely to stick with labour than vote tory in but we lost support among older working women and lowerincome women who no longer benefited from family support but were feeling squeezed nonetheless perhaps worrying about older children pension savings or the cost of living many of these women are now feeling betrayed by the government our campaigns on womens pension age and tuition fees respond to some of their concerns but we need to do more to listen and to sustain their support from equal pay to doubling childcare from strengthening domestic violence laws to extending maternity leave labour did much in government to improve womens lives and labour women are campaigning to stop the clock being turned back now the tories and lib dems have abandoned women

last week probably for the first time in its history cohabitation acquired a good name from defenders of the state of matrimony according to a study for the office for national statistics ons the key to a strong marriage is to live together first cohabitation allegedly screens out those who would otherwise marry and divorce in the s fewer than one in adults under cohabited now it is one in six in recent years of couples who marry have lived together first ons researchers suggest that cohabitation because of its testrun potential is seen as promoting rather than competing with marriage so if the terms of engagement have changed as it were then it seems only fair to ask that legal rights for cohabitees should once again be considered common law marriage hasnt existed in england and wales since although more than of the population believe that it does as a result at the end of a relationship the law treats cohabitees as two unrelated individuals with no right to claim for maintenance except for the children or a share of the property rights for cohabitees were resisted in the past because opponents argued this would undermine marriage now cohabitation appears to have become a valuable marital prop surely its only fair that those who continue for a variety of reasons to resist the orange blossom and nuptials are entitled to a better personal security campaigners have fought to win a change in the law and several governments including this one have refused to see reason on the whole its those who are poorer less welleducated and less wellqualified who remain as cohabitees although that too is beginning to change they live together for a variety of reasons the partner doesnt want to they cant afford a wedding they resist the interference of the state thats their choice the fact that as a result they and their children are left unfairly vulnerable when cupids arrows cease to fly now seems even more unjust,2011-09,last week probably first time history cohabitation

for the first time in years i found the liberal democrat conference rather riveting it wasnt the policies that drew me in or the tubthumping jeering at their tory coalition partners nor was i particularly fascinated by the image of a delegate almost entirely covered in tattoos which was reprinted ad nauseam in various newspapers as evidence of just how weird lib dem supporters are these days hes got tattoos on his face get him to a freak show immediately with some eightyearold cagefighters no the reason i found it more entertaining than usual was because of the women there was miriam clegg resplendent in a canaryyellow topshop dress and blowdried hair so bouncy it could singlehandedly prevent a double dip recession there was vicky pryce spurned exwife of the energy secretary chris huhne walking perilously close to carina trimingham the scarily tall other woman and there was lynne featherstone equalities minister spouting some ridiculous claptrap apparently picked up from a beyonc song about how girls should rule the world her actual argument delivered to a fringe meeting was that if you leave things to men you get terrible decisions look at the mess the world is in and look who has been in charge she said leaving aside the fact that over the past years there have been quite a few women running fairly important things like um countries margaret thatcher angela merkel the newlyelected helle thorningschmidt what galls me most about featherstones comment is that it falls into the trap of inverse sexism of treating women and men as a homogenised mass of femaleness or maleness she is not alone in this unfortunate generalisation since the economic crisis of it has become fashionable to argue that everything could have been neatly avoided if only there had been more traders in possession of vaginas harriet harman said if it had been lehman sisters rather than lehman brothers there might not have been so much difficulty while neuroscientist dr john coates blamed the financial meltdown on testosterone and the male appetite for risk women have only of the testosterone men have he said before going on to point out that older men also have considerably less a point ignored by harman presumably because lehman codgers was a less sexy soundbite its patronising and objectionable to be told that women as a whole are somehow less riskaverse more empathetic and more able to compromise than men several women i know not least my sister who rides motorbikes shoots rifles and flies aeroplanes though thankfully not all at the same time are exhilarated by the idea of risk just as many men of my acquaintance admit to welling up when theyre watching x factor im sure there are some women who would be good traders or chief executives but im equally sure that others would make terrible bosses either because they go out of their way to prove they can be as ballbusting as their male counterparts or because they feel threatened by other women similarly some men make great employers others do not whether people are effective in their job or not has nothing to do with gender and everything to do with their capabilities the notion that women are not as aggressive as men that we would all just sit around a table eating red velvet cupcakes and talking out the worlds problems rather than firing off phallicshaped nuclear weapons is a complete fallacy and you can imagine that if the opposite argument had been made that men would be far better at running mumsnet say because theyd thrash out any disagreements on the rugby pitch rather than allowing bitchy anonymous blog posts there would have rightly been an outcry there should be more women at the top of their professions but lets not automatically assume the world would be so much better just because theyve got a pair of ovaries downton ads are a real downer for months weve been sitting on the edge of our sofas eagerly awaiting the return of the television event of the decade i talk naturally not of downton abbey but of the aviva insurance company advertisements last week itv faced a barrage of complaints from viewers upset that their magical downton experience with swelling orchestral strings great war romance and belowstairs intrigue had been ruined by a series of second idents at the beginning and end of each commercial break for some reason aviva chose to dramatise the story of gary a reallife customer who had fallen off his motorbike and lost his job without realising that most of us watch downton abbey for sunday night escapism and not to be reminded of how horribly unfair modern life can be you immediately felt bad for not wishing to follow poor garys plight a bit like trying to avoid eye contact with the clipboardwielding charity fundraiser in the street yet there is an increasing trend in advertising to create authentic stories so that we are left basking in the glow of faux community it all started with the ubiquitous howard in the halifax ads the belief by corporations that if the public can be persuaded it knows the characters involved it will by extension be more warmly disposed towards buying things promoted by them so it is that we have the harassedbutkindly tesco family or adam and jane the bt couple who share the ups and downs of their relationships while all the time making use of excellent broadband speeds are any of us genuinely convinced by this guff i doubt it if im going to buy insurance im more likely to take advice from the countess of grantham than from gary give me brief encounter not blackberry sex i recently saw friends with benefits an enjoyable romcom starring justin timberlake and mila kunis as mates who go down the jobcentre every week to sign on no just kidding theyre friends who sleep together sex the characters insist is like playing tennis a satisfying and mutually enjoyable physical act with the minimum of emotional fuss its a terribly modern conceit and as if to reflect the uptotheminute nature of the plot the film is saturated with technology tickets are booked on blackberrys music is played on a smartphone an oath is taken over an ipad bible app it made me feel nostalgic for the days when movie love affairs were conducted on train platforms and marriage proposals were sent by telegram but then i realised that given the hectic pace of technological advance iphone anyone it will only be a couple of years before friends with benefits is seen as a charming period piece one day our grandchildren will look at film actors using mobile phones and see it as the equivalent of onscreen

dozens of feminists have staged a protest in central london to protest against the meat market of the pornography industry as adult entertainment executives attended an international trade summit in

dealmaking opportunities but to the men and women protesting the conferences slick image conceals a disturbing reality of misogyny in stcentury pornography julia long of the london feminist network said this summit is being presented as a lavish respectable corporate event when in fact it is a brazen opportunity for the porn industry to plan new ways of profiting from the exploitation of women watching the protest claire wigington head of marketing of television x said this argument was simplified its easy to say porn degrades women but the women in the industry know what theyre doing she said in recent years the multibillion dollar industry has become a focus for the feminist movement as fears grow over the impact its pervasive influence is having on society at large activists claim that viewing pornography can lead to greater acceptance of rape myths and attitudes supporting violence against women gail dines academic and author of pornland how porn has hijacked our sexuality said it was central to the fight for equality you cannot have a massive industry built on the sexual torture and dehumanisation and debasement of women if you want any gender equality in a society you cannot have this industry steamrollering into mens psyches sexuality and identity she said adding that there was an immeasurable difference between the xrated industry of decades ago and the kind of bodypunishing hardcore material available now which she says has become the major seller in the industry today not all feminists agree however catherine stephens an activist for the international union of sex workers said opposing pornography as a whole did not make sense as there were so many different kinds this porn summit represents pimps in suits meeting to plot how to push the boundaries of porn even further to increase their profits said anna van heeswijk campaigns coordinator of the activist group object which organised the protest along with uk feminista and other groups it is

according to the documentaries running on nearconstant repeat on cnn and msnbc men all around america are just waiting to buy women for sex fuelling what is referred to as a multibillion dollar industry in cnns latest sex trade special selling the girl next door were told that girls are routinely bought and sold for the pleasure of grown men attorneys general mayors and sheriffs across the united states are using the same tabloid statistics and rationale to set public policy they claim that the way to end exploitation in the sex trade is to end demand for the sex trade that is end mens desire for sex they can pay for the notion that mens desire to buy actual people fuels the sex trade has gone so mainstream that when aspiring celebrity philanthropist ashton kutcher launched a public service campaign against prostitution this year he called it real men dont buy girls the problem is real people buy sex and real people sell sex the numbers on how many people are involved in the sex trade are notoriously hard to gather or trust but there is one constant buyers are not buying people when politicians social service providers and celebrity philanthropists insist that sex workers are selling ourselves they engage in the same kind of dehumanisation that they claim johns do to us when they claim that men can buy us they rob us of our power and our choices if youre someone whose understanding of the sex trade is patched together from cable specials like these with their endless reels of women in miniskirts and fishnets and boots leaning into cars its probably impossible to imagine that sex workers have power or choices from reading prostitution advertisements online or from recalling the kind of carnival sideshow pitch you might hear at a strip club its tempting to imagine that sex workers will do whatever men pay them to do and that sex workers exist to cater to male desire what sex workers are actually selling is our ability to make our customers think they are getting what they want and we try to sell that with as little strain on our time and our bodies as possible you wouldnt be able to tell this from sex trade ads because it would be incredibly bad marketing but its the illusion around which sex work turns combined with the myth that all prostitution involves men buying women the end mens demand rhetoric in the media and antiprostitution campaigns plays into some of the most damaging attitudes toward sex workers theres nothing feminist or new in the current wave of antiprostitution reformers who claim as does the demand abolition coalition which is led by former us ambassador swanee hunt and actress ashley judd among others that all sex work is sexual enslavement sex workers know that what creates demand for the sex trade is not men enslaving us for sex but the exigencies of survival the demand for the sex trade lies in the demands of childcare loan officers debt collectors landlords and dependant family members in short the demands most working people struggle to meet given the gravity of these real systemic demands that sex workers face to focus only on ending mens demand for sex is a cheap way out in this way sex workers needs are reduced only to what happens during the sex transaction it ignores the rest of our lives outside the sex trade by advancing this myth of male demand and sex workers being powerlessly enslaved in catering to it the media and politicians fixate on the power of male desire more than sex workers ever do this is the problem with outsiders to the sex trade attempting to control it people who have such limited experience of the sex trade are left governing with their fears worse we know from the example of former new york governor eliot spitzer that elected officials may have another source of sex trade expertise to draw on their own patronage when they base their campaigning not on the reality of the sex trade but on their fantasies it is sex workers who most

even if the lib dems are promising to sort them out soon even poor hugh hefner was having a stab at it until his fiancee changed her mind at the last minute ive been to two in the last month this is weird no one would have thought that a failure rate approaching would be enough to give most people pause they are not good odds divorce rates are actually going down but they are still impressive about couples per thousand divorce every year which doesnt sound like much but thats per thousand over a year period in my case the failure rate so far is and yet it wasnt so long ago that i tentatively raised the idea with the woman i was then in love with i wasnt joking so there is something about marriage these days its something like a refusal to look at the facts when milton in

really important thing about marriage now that a bastard is no longer an illegitimate child but someone who cuts you up on the roundabout whats important about marriage now it seems is the expense not only are people marrying when theres a decent chance it will all go wrong and of those that remain together one suspects not all will be blissful theyre spending something like a years salary on the party average cost of a wedding in the uk and not only that it has to be just so with enormous attention paid to every single detail gone it seems are the days when a couple could tie the knot quietly in a registry office and slip away for a romantic week in bruges the weddings i went to last month were of another order entirely to the last load i went to years ago for various demographic reasons ones personal experience of weddings as a guest comes in clumps like this its not that they were skimping back in the s its just that these days its off the chain in my day the groom could make do with wearing his own best suit these days even the male guests are expected to hire something with tails from moss bros adding another several thousand to the cost of a wedding but at least the brides dad doesnt have to stump up for that and nowadays the food is meant to be good not just barely tolerable boiledsalmonandnewpotatoes muck that blighted all my more youthful wedding parties i find this rather worrying and cannot help but wonder whether a massively expensive wedding has anything to do with love instead of a feast celebrating both agape and eros we have a strictly regimented drilled occasion that has to conform to a rigid template and whose most significant factor is the expense as a guest this is fine by me i like a ritual i like dressing up i am not paying the foods good and there is more drink than you can actually drink you also have the amusing lottery of who you are going to sit next to at dinner and best mans speeches excepted and providing im not the one getting married i always have a really really good time at weddings but you cant help wondering if afterwards the bride and groom are left with an enormous sense of anticlimax oscar wilde said that women marry because they are curious and men because they are tired after a typical wedding these days both bride and groom must be absolutely exhausted,2011-09,seems though everyone want marry michael

its an interesting week to be a woman in new york and in particular a black woman this week sees the un general assembly convene to consider the millennium development goals and its commitment to women newsweek publishes its global womens progress report highlighting the fact that women hold the highest political offices from thailand to brazil costa rica and australia and there is the second annual women inspiration and enterprise wie symposium in soho new york hosted by arianna huffington sarah brown and donna karan a panel on what it means to be a woman now struck a chord as it shone a spotlight on successful black women from cofounder of the conference dee poku former head of international marketing at paramount pictures to the model iman and editoratlarge of essence magazine mikki taylor as a black woman in the us media there are now myriad opportunities call it the michelle obama effect or the fact that there are simply more media channels and avenues open to black women in my industry but it seems like it really is a great time to be a black woman in this country im in awe of the number of black presenters on tv and in top editorial positions at mainstream magazines such as newly appointed fashion features editor at glamour magazine rajni jacques or paper womens market editor zandile blay not to mention kenya hunt global fashion editor of the metro newspaper in the us then there is soledad obrien an anchor and special correspondent for cnnus who produces whole segments highlighting the issues affecting people of colour and robin givhan headhunted from the washington post earlier this year by newsweek because of her pulitzer prizewinning fashion writing there is less of a feeling in the us that you have to wait for someone of colour to step aside to make room for you there isnt just one trevor mcdonald as wonderful as he is presenting the news a sentiment shared by a number of black british actors and entertainers such as comedian gina yashere who said to hannah pool in an interview with this newspaper i cant wait for lenny henry to die just so i can get a tv show she is now selling out arenas in new york and la mikki taylor at essence also believes this is a good time to be a black woman in the us we are the women whose time has come you hear it in their conversations we are children of the dream were the outpouring of those who paved the way for us who made it possible for us to own our lives now and be who we are i think this has been coming a long time and im excited to see what well do with this she says like many women ive been helped by role models and mentors along the way my mother cultivated my love of journalism in the first place by bringing home a poster of successful black journalist claudia jones who is celebrated each year in the nuj claudia jones lecture and sticking it on the wall in my room she then found a youth journalism club called childrens express for me to attend june sarpong who ran the wie conference also mentored me when i was a television runner on t the youth show on channel back in the early s by offering me real support and advice after she went from a receptionist at channel to presenting with the help of mentors through junes success and my mothers belief in me i never believed i couldnt have a career in the media because of the amount of melanin in my skin of course its not all good news there still isnt gender equality in the workforce recent figures from the us department of labour revealed that women in the us earn of the median weekly earnings of their male counterparts a similar pattern of gender inequality in the boardroom is noticeable in the uk too also even among women there are disparities across race in the us womens inflationadjusted earnings grew significantly from to during this period inflationadjusted earnings for white women rose by compared to for black women showing that growth in real earnings for white women outpaced that of their black counterparts in addition to this author and stanford law professor ralph richard banks has just launched a book called is marriage for white people looking at dating and romance in black america banks looks at why successful black women are half as likely as white women to be married and more than three times as likely as white women never to marry by conducting over interviews with people of colour he focuses on arguments that are prolific in the community about black women significantly outperforming black men in school and in university not to mention the high rates of incarceration for black men which poses a challenge for women who want to marry within their race globally black women arent fairing very well either whether it be high rates of mortality in childbirth in africa women and children suffering the destruction and the slow rebuilding of haiti which has largely been ignored in recent months once the celebrity angle disappeared or an interesting fact i found out from a midwife and white ribbon alliance advocate from tanzania at the wie symposium that pregnant women in her country have to walk up to km to get to health care facilities so what do you think is it a great time to be a woman now is it a great time to be a black woman do we need more mentors have we only begun to take the steps needed to create change and what is needed next,2011-09,interesting

violence in teenage relationships is much more prevalent than previously thought with those from disadvantaged backgrounds twice as likely to be abused by violent partners according to a study the research carried out by bristol university in conjunction with the nspcc found those from poorer backgrounds are twice as likely to be abused as their betteroff counterparts and it is a problem that affects both young girls and boys interviews with boys and girls aged who were not in mainstream education found physical emotional and sexual abuse was commonplace more than half the girls said they had been in a sexually violent relationship before they were and half had experienced physical violence one in four boys said they had been in relationships with physically aggressive partners the report standing on my own two feet contacted the young people through a range of agencies across southwest england emma who was interviewed for the study told researchers how she had been forced into having sex quite a few times when she was ive never shouted rape or anything ive never been able to say that ive been raped but its not like ive given consent in certain situations it has been pushed on me and it has been really horrible another young woman brenda who was involved in a violent relationship from the age of but was not part of the study says the experience changed her view of what was normal it was my first proper relationship she said i didnt have a template for what was normal he started taking control of what i did when i wasnt with him and how i spent my money he made excuses about my friends and made me feel bad if i wanted to spend time with them and said i loved them more than me so i became isolated he told me i was fat and worthless and he slapped me i was raped a couple of times the worst thing was having so little worth that i wouldnt find the strength to leave at least i didnt live with him so it made it easier when i did go brenda is not particularly close to her parents and says they did not offer to intervene at the time in hindsight if they had tried to help i probably wouldnt have listened she added three years on she is engaged to a partner who treats her with respect and is very different to her former boyfriend the main difference is i can say what i think to him even if he doesnt agree with it without worrying that something bad is going to happen my idea of what is normal has changed so drastically when you are with someone abusive it is like they rewrite normality while half of all those taking part in the research had been assigned a social worker most did not reveal their partners violence many said welfare professionals were not interested in this aspect of their lives the study follows on from a survey in also by bristol university on behalf of the nspcc of girls aged who were not considered to be from vulnerable backgrounds it found a third suffered sexual abuse in a relationship and a quarter experienced violence at the hands of their boyfriends the publication of the report comes as the government launches the second phase of its advertising campaign to challenge teenagers attitudes to violence and abuse in relationships on wednesday experts said that although the study does not claim to be representative of the uk population it suggests levels of violence in teenage relationships may be much higher than previously assumed home office minister lynne featherstone welcomed the report and said m of central funding had been ringfenced for local domestic violence services but the nspccs chief executive andrew flanagan called for more services to help young people suffering violence at the hands of their partners in the young girls the violence could be being punched in the face black eyes broken teeth pushed down stairs or dragged by their hair he said in the male children we did not find those levels but still over of boys suffered some form of physical violence he said it suggested that sexual violence for young people was now more likely to be perpetrated by a partner or peer than a parent or a relative we have to recognise that campaigning while it is very good is not enough in itself we need extra services he said flanagan wants to see specific programmes around partner violence and control in relationships he added we have to recognise that domestic abuse starts very early its not when people become adults its what they see and learn in their early years we need to address this issue now professor david berridge from bristol university who was one of the report authors said many teenagers who took part in the study accepted violence as normal and many blamed themselves he said many also suffered from emotional violence being controlled or intimidated by their partner the study found many young women opted to stay with violent partners rather than risk the stigma of being a single mother berridge said we would want teenage partner violence to be seen almost not dissimilar to adult domestic violence its not a million miles away from it,2011-09,violence teenage relationship much prevalent previously thought disadvantaged

under mediterranean skies the no blue skies department chanced upon a thought its last big idea curbing maternity rights had grabbed the wrong sort of attention and perhaps thats why the new brainwave is to show some regard for the opinion of women the shopping list of policies inspired by this impulse revealed in wednesdays guardian mix the good restricting advertising for children the irrelevant downing street summits and the impractical the most important fall into the final category gearing social security towards younger children for instance is admirable in theory but not achievable now where labour took this tack it was about targeting extra money now with child benefit frozen in the face of rising inflation finding extra money for tots would involve imposing an even more miserable time on mothers of teens than that which is already in store if that strains the realms of political possibility the idea of paying all benefits by default to the woman is probably beyond the pale in legal terms crass talk about the womens vote is itself evidence of the continuing grip of an ancient mindset which conceives female voters as an exotic variation on the ordinary type in truth region and class still matter more for voting than sex and polling on gender reveals more complexities than easy generalisations nonetheless it appears women have been switching off the coalition more rapidly than men one possible reason was suggested by ifs analysis this week which showed families with children were suffering from the harshest austerity gendered politics arguably flow inexorably from the decision not merely to cut the deficit but to rely on spending cuts rather than tax rises it is still all too often the unpaid lot of women to care for the young and the frail who are the principal users of all those welfare services that are feeling the squeeze and where women are paid for their work it is disproportionately by public employers who are now squeezing terms and shedding jobs as new figures confirmed yesterday the government can and should promote women in business and david cameron who has a decent record in reforming candidate selection would be better placed to make such arguments if he expanded the female quotient of ministers but it is the breadandbutter issues that count and here it must be admitted that the fiscal plans impose a bind but even cashstrapped governments have choices to make as this government did by relieving fuel duty in the budget while it puts such giveaways ahead of family services its strategies for women will have all

the home secretary theresa may has appealed to firms to publish information on paygaps and promotion rates across the gender divide as part of a coalition drive to attract more women voters may gave a speech on pay inequality and appeared on bbc radio s womans hour on wednesday while david cameron hinted in the commons that the government will introduce further measures to improve female representation in boardrooms and westminster as part of a charm offensive to win back womens support it came a day after the guardian revealed a leaked government policy memo exposing anxiety at the heart of the coalition over their poor polling with women voters and setting out ideas to reach out to them including shortening the school holidays frontloading child benefit and banning advertising to children it is now understood that the document was commissioned by the liberal democrats however the tories are also deeply concerned at their polling with women may announced that tesco bt and the law firm eversheds have signed up to the voluntary reporting scheme and will publish equality data on their staffing on their websites in some cases including full pay audits she said it was wrong that among full time workers a gender pay gap of more than had persisted asked on womans hour why existing laws that would make gender auditing mandatory had not been enacted she said the mandatory power is still available in the act but i think if you make something mandatory they do it but only to the point at which they have to do it were encouraging companies to look more widely at their equality issues in their workplace she confirmed that the government is looking across the board at how its policies affect women and appeared to recognise that women are bearing the brunt of the economic strategy to cut the deficit it is very tough out there for a lot of people at the moment she said i know that and obviously we are hearing figures on the economy that show that things are choppy and difficult for people i recognise that i think women will look at a variety of issues they will look at their own personal circumstances what the government is doing to help them back into the work place but they will also look at what were doing for their families the fawcett society which campaigns for womens rights welcomed mays recognition of the problem but said that the government was failing to acknowledge the full impact of its cuts on women anna bird acting chief executive said sadly it appears the government thinks the problem is one of perception not reality in response to a year high in womens unemployment the government seems to think an exercise in spin or at best a few cheap wins is called for anne longfield director of the charity children said the government should take note of the unicef report this week which found that children are stuck in a materialistic trap because their parents use gifts to try to appease their guilt over struggling to spend time with them she said the pressure on mothers especially to give children the time they know they need and deliver everything else and enough money leaves many feeling a real sense of constant underperforming and guilt under the current economic plans of course people start to blame the government the government has got to take the prime ministers promise to familyproof its policies more seriously at prime ministers questions on wednesday cameron said that more changes could be introduced to encourage more women to become mps and join company boards only of ftse company directors are women we should do far better he said we need to take much more proactive action to make sure we have a much better balance at the top of politics we need a much better balance at the top of our

of paid leave a year to care for a sick grandchild if parents cant she pointed to employees at asda where they are entitled to days unpaid leave at the birth of a grandchild or for a childs first day

inside no parallel operations have been launched to win over disgruntled women voters the document revealing the anxiety at the heart of government over the polling of women leaked to the guardian on tuesday was drawn up by downing streets policy unit but commissioned by the deputy pm nick clegg the conservatives marshalled by camerons head of strategy andrew cooper have spent the summer trying to analyse where they are going wrong one liberal democrat said that while the loss of female voters was of deep concern to both parties they believed the tories were devoting more time to a package of measures to reverse the trend this week cooper and camerons head of communications craig oliver held a meeting for tory advisers from across whitehall to discuss the problems in attracting women voters both parties share concerns about the disproportionate impact of the cuts on women but the tories inside downing street have to face up to some highprofile cringeworthy issues an example flared up last week when mp nadine dorries moved to change the regulations around abortion and cameron called the female mp frustrated one senior conservative in downing street told the guardian they were particularly interested in the possibility that feelings of guilt were affecting womens attitudes to the coalition as part of their summer of research into the partys relationship with women and what can be done about it officials met representatives from the supermarket asda which rigorously monitors the feelings and opinions of its millions of customers the party especially wants to understand c voters who since the formation of the coalition have deserted in droves the representatives told tory policymakers that women were overwhelmingly describing feeling guilty during the squeeze on living standards since they felt they could not give their children the material comforts they themselves might have had as children and in some cases that their childrens friends do have in some cases leading to their children then being bullied the fear in no is that the government is being blamed for this the view is pushed up the agenda by a report from unicef which suggests that parents are compulsively buying their children the latest clothes gifts and gadgets in a guilty attempt to make up for the lack of time spent together crucially that pinpointed economic pressures on families as a cause of the problems recommending the introduction of a living wage to take the pressure off theres a strong possibility that tory strategists will use some of the policy ideas debating shorter school holidays frontloading child benefit and banning advertising to children that came through in the work clegg commissioned the two sides of the coalition could join forces to tackle their individual problems with women but there are limits recently camerons director of communications steve hilton who is pushing for the deregulationof business on all fronts was reported in july to have suggested that abolishing maternity leave would actually help increase womens chances in the work place clegg however would block any attempt by hilton to end maternity leave,2011-09,inside parallel

jonathan dean reacts dismissively to the news that i am suing the gender institute of the london school of economics where i was a student fear not male readers september martin claims he had the misfortune of being subject to a torrent of antimale discrimination dean writes adding martin alleges that the course material he studied was systematically antimale overlooked mens issues and ignored any research that contested a women good men bad line of reasoning furthermore he claims the gender institute drummed into the students a simplistic view of women as victims and men as perpetrators dean a former researcher at lses gender institute denies everything gender studies programmes encourage students to acknowledge the limitations of a victimcentred understanding of womanhood fine words but a close analysis of the core texts shows all the old maleblaming biases are still there patriarchy theory the idea that men typically dominate women is omnipresent when research shows women tend to boss men interpersonally texts highlight misogyny but never misandry its antimale equivalent despite research finding that women verbalise four times more misandry than men do misogyny and the core texts highlight violence against women only despite decades of research showing that women are more likely to initiate domestic violence lets get a few things straight says dean the dominant ideas approaches and insights of the vast majority of academic disciplines are produced by for and about men there are entrenched gender biases in most fields the key texts are overwhelmingly by and about men by men perhaps but discussions about actual mens issues are generally absent across curricula by pretending mens issues are disproportionately focused on and by implying there is lots of antifemale bias elsewhere dean attempts to justify the continuation of attacks on men and avoidance of mensissues debates as is standard in the gender studies orthodoxy today when womens studies became gender studies departments it signalled a new era of inclusion for mens issues a rejection of this now is a betrayal of men and equality dean offers up some token men the likes of jeff hearn and michael kimmel have paved the way for increasing numbers of men to contribute to academic gender studies so which issues do these academics actually discuss class and racial inequalities between men the causes and consequences of male violence the lived experiences of different kinds of male sexuality and the ways in which ideas of masculinity influence social and political thought so discussions of male violence but not femaleonmale violence dean is effectively admitting the bias the gender orthodoxy refuses to mention all those people fighting for equality in the fathers rights movement or all those boys and men enslaved in conscription or mens shorter life expectancies i enrolled at lses elite gender institute to learn how best to combat discrimination in a world which

this may come as a surprise to those of us who see a bluetinged condom when we look at his face but women helped put david cameron in downing street in particular the big swing of support away from labour and towards the conservatives by women working in skilled manual jobs was one of the many hammering blows to gordon browns prime ministerial career the tories have tried to capitalise on this success with a creature they dubbed the holby city woman middleaged women doing clinical or clerical jobs though not all in the fictional hospital by trumpeting that they would be the most family friendly government ever oddly their definition of family friendly has included cuts to child benefit the child trust fund and maternity support since coming to power even childless women admittedly not a group much mentioned by the coalition have been hit harder than men by the greater number of jobs lost in the public sector so it should come as no surprise that research from the resolution foundation shows that overall levels of approval for the government have fallen to among women lower than for men talking of the womens vote should always come with a caveat of course we dont talk of the mens vote but evidence of collapsing support from the female c vote that provided such key support in marginal seats is so worrying cameron that he is poring almost masochistically over polling evidence according to the daily mail so what to do the first thing seems to be to assemble a group to point out that policies that hurt the largely female workforce dependent on public sector pay and pensions compared with highly paid bankers nearly all men will not be universally popular too much of the resulting policy document unveiled by my colleague polly curtis is concerned with presentation and pr i know this shouldnt come as a surprise for a coalition run by a former pr man but the most patronising suggestion was the one that women who are struggling to make ends meet will be cheered by changes to child benefit that frontload support for babies these are the women lest we forget who have just lost child trust funds as well as child tax credits even the policy wonks behind the document admit that giving universal credits to women directly is a largely symbolic gesture while a proper ban on advertising to children should have happened already given how often mps talk of it when not in the company of big business again im not sure that holding your own personal budget for a maternity service helps when you cant find an available midwife within a mile radius ditto education vouchers but there are some interesting ideas that warrant discussion among the suggestions included in this mini manifesto the idea of a paysharing website in order to provide some transparency on equal pay is a good one as is having a debate on the long summer holiday although im not sure how that helps teachers many of whom are er women anything that highlights the uks poor progress on women in senior business positions should be welcomed as long as a no summit is not just that and results in a proper action despite the very real issues at the heart of this document it would be foolish to deny that there is a communications issue here brown was defeated by the economy spiralling away from him but he was not helped by his image as a bit of a macho bully similarly it will be his handling of the economy that does for cameron but he cannot be helped by the sense that this old etonian with the blacktie wearing chancellor joking about masturbation cannot truly

downing street is considering cutting the school summer holiday overhauling child benefit and banning advertising to unders as part of a charm offensive aimed at winning back female voters according to a leaked government memo the document reveals a growing anxiety at the heart of government that the coalition is failing to deliver on its promise to be the most familyfriendly government ever and a worry that its support among women is particularly low the fourpage document marked restricted policy was written by officials at no and circulated to government departments in the past week it includes proposals to put together a crossgovernment communications team to announce a series of elaborate policies designed to win women back it cites an urgent need to up our game on communications about what were doing it says we are clear that there are a range of policies we have pursued as a government which are seen as having hit women or their interests disproportionately the document mentions public sector pay and pensions as an example particularly as contrasted with mostly male bankers in the popular narrative the proposals include moves to debate a reduction in the long summer holiday to help working families if were feeling brave it says this is tricky in the context of more school autonomy but we could try some exhortation it adds other measures raised include frontloading child benefit to help parents struggling with childcare and lost earnings in their childrens first years working towards a proper ban on advertising to children introducing personal budgets for maternity services to allow women to shop around for services developing a strategy including possible crossparty work to ensure there are more female candidates for mayoral posts elected police commissions and local enterprise partnerships changing plans for the new universal credit to give it to women automatically instead of allowing the applicant to nominate a household member setting up a website to allow women to anonymously disclose and compare their salaries with others in their industry criminalising forced marriage because the signals sent out by opting not to criminalise is a bad one holding a no summit for women in business we havent had one yet it acknowledges labour claims the governments economic strategy has hit women hardest as they bear the brunt of the reforms to welfare and benefits as well as job cuts in the public sector and the coalitions ratings among women have plummeted david cameron has been accused of sexism on occasions including when he told one female labour mp to calm down dear last weeks commons debate on abortion stirred the issues once more the document is understood to have been developed by the no policy unit headed by steve hilton and is in marked contrast to the last leak from his office that memo proposed abolishing maternity rights to help aid the economic recovery and startled ministers who urgently sought to distance the government from it camerons chief strategist the former pollster andrew cooper is also working on the issue and has spent the summer analysing the problem of women and the coalition this week downing street is to hold a meeting with officials from across government including some from the office of the home secretary theresa may no refused to comment on the leaked document but a source stressed that the nature of the document was to raise ideas for discussion and that no decisions had been reached the document says that women have reacted badly to visible and prominent issues including tuition fees abolition of child trust funds changes to child tax credits benefits and income support the coalitions womenfriendly policies on flexible working parental leave nursery places and health visitors have meanwhile failed to register it notes there are also areas where we have made bold statements or promises but havent delivered enough including for example our overarching claim that we would be the most familyfriendly government ever and specific undertakings to increase the representation of women on boards it says the paper refers to suggestions that women have particular concerns about the future for their children and the next generations we need to change our messaging about deficit reduction it concludes talk less about sorting out a mess and more about building a better economy for the future meetings have been held between female officials at the centre of government tasked with identifying the governments failure with women the document says the group of cabinet office and no women we assembled felt strongly that the general tone and messages of government communications particularly around deficit reduction were an issue with women especially in the public sector feeling targeted and even a view that the governments choice of leaders on the economy gave the implication that now theres a real job to be done sorting out the mess it can only be done by men womens votes are increasingly seen as crucial for the next election polling by ipsos mori commissioned and published by the resolution foundation concludes that support for the coalition among female voters in the c socioeconomic group mostly lowskilled workers has fallen away over the course of this year the tory rating with c women is down by seven points and the lib dems are down points itthe polling also shows that the proportion of women aged who support the tories has declined from at the general election to just in and support for the lib dems among the same group has fallen from to just overall levels of approval for the coalition have fallen to among women lower than for men just of women feel the tory party is the party closest to women only believe the lib dems are yvette cooper the shadow home secretary and minister for equalities said women dont want more spin and communications professionals they want fundamental changes to government policy

feminism makes some men very scared others very angry tom martin who is taking legal action against the london school of economics risks being seen as falling into both of these categories a former student at the lse gender institute martin claims he had the misfortune of being subject to a torrent of antimale discrimination during his very brief time there and has cited the gender equality duty to support his case the irony of attacking feminists by invoking a piece of legislation whose existence is largely down to the energy and commitment of feminist campaigners scarcely needs pointing out martin alleges that the course material he studied during his six weeks at the lse was systematically antimale overlooked mens issues and ignored any research that contested a women good men bad line of reasoning furthermore martin claims that the gender institute drummed into the students with quasireligious fervour a simplistic view of women as victims and men as perpetrators if his experience is anything to go by any selfrespecting male should steer well clear of such institutionalised misandry well male readers before you start cowering behind the sofa fearful of the castrating gender studies professor whos about to get you let me reassure you although i dont know the specifics of martins experience i am a male academic active in gender studies and was a researcher at the very institution that martin is suing and yet for me as with many other male gender studies scholars and students my academic engagement with feminism and gender issues has been nothing short of lifeaffirming lets get a few things straight the dominant ideas approaches and insights of the vast majority of academic disciplines are produced by for and about men this does not necessarily make them bad ideas but it does mean that there are entrenched gender biases in most fields in my own discipline politics the key undergraduate texts are overwhelmingly by and about men and yet this is seen by most as unproblematic as natural or inevitable gender studies is an attempt to critique this entrenched male bias as an emerging area of study it remains small and lacks the financial and institutional clout of the bigger disciplines it strikes me as utterly bemusing that one would want to direct ones ire towards one of the few academic spaces in which the implications of biases that go largely unchallenged elsewhere are explored but lets clear up a few further points firstly the perception that gender studies is doctrinal and dogmatic is simply untrue it is sceptical of traditional distinctions between fields of research and is more dynamic innovative and open to new perspectives than established disciplines and far from sticking to a crude women good men bad line gender studies programmes encourage students to acknowledge the diversity of relations between men and women the limitations of a victimcentred understanding of womanhood and the complex ways in which gender intersects with race class and sexuality the development of this more holistic approach to gender analysis is one of the reasons why the name gender studies is now usually given preference over womens studies although the name of the field remains a controversial topic what is not in dispute though is the contribution to gender studies of current research into the changing nature of masculinity scholars such as jeff hearn r w connell keith pringle michael kimmel and terrell carver have all taken inspiration from feminism and womens studies to analyse for example class and racial inequalities between men the causes and consequences of male violence the lived experience of different kinds of male sexuality and the ways in which ideas of masculinity influence social and political thought although most gender studies scholars and students are women the likes of jeff hearn and michael kimmel have paved the way for increasing numbers of men to contribute to academic gender studies contributions that have been unambiguously welcomed in this context if a gender studies scholar were to put forward a crude women good men bad analysis it would never stand up to peer scrutiny finally gender studies courses are extremely friendly and supportive environments in contrast to the stuffiness and conformity of many academic settings gender studies students and scholars

yougov has just published a survey showing how people feel about seeing others kissing on tv i know its not exactly the question we were all asking but never mind interviewees were asked to picture this scenario a british soap opera recently included a scene where two gay men were shown lying in bed together with no tops on and bedclothes pulled up to their chests the two characters also shared a brief kiss the pollsters then asked people whether they thought this was acceptable before the pm watershed only after the watershed or not acceptable at any time people were also asked how they felt about exactly the same televisual scenario but featuring a man and a woman perhaps unmarried a married heterosexual couple and two gay women nationwide thought two men kissing was acceptable before the watershed only after the watershed and thought it was always always unacceptable compare and contrast this with results for the fine upstanding married couple kissing thought that was ok prewatershed post never this wasnt a scenario that yougov had plucked from the ether their question was a direct lift of a line from an article in the daily mail back in june headlined eastenders sparks uproar with gay bedroom scene before the watershed of course there hadnt really been any great uproar such outrage is almost always manufactured by the press as was this a mere people had complained to the bbc about a programme that attracts million viewers hardly a sign that many are really bothered about this sort of thing any more more interestingly though the yougov survey broke down its findings by political affiliation gender age class and region which gave a fascinating insight into the contours of homophobia in britain today as might be expected people are more tolerant of homosexuality the younger they are more than half of all people under thought it was all fine before the watershed while of people over thought a gay male kiss was never acceptable which by my admittedly dodgy maths suggests the least controversial place to show gay samesexing would be the childrens cbbc channel tory voters were the most uncomfortable with the whole gay kiss thing but then of conservatives didnt even approve of straight kissing outside marriage its nice to have standards dont you think the most accepting and least hypocritical voters were lib dems a levelheaded were comfortable with any gendervariant of kissing before the watershed curiously labour voters were the only ones out of all the categories who found gay male kissing more acceptable than lesbian kissing they may have to convene a focus group to explain that one and yes women were more relaxed about seeing a manonman kiss than men were but only slightly just as predictably men seemed rather more enthusiastic about the thought of lesbians locking lips the great samesex kissingontv debate was kicked off last may with another story in the daily mail indecent lesbian kiss scenes face watershed crackdown naturally the mail illustrated this nonstory with a photo of two lesbians kissing the mail claimed a review launched with the backing of david cameron is expected to recommend that sexually suggestive scenes currently allowed before the pm watershed such as the famous lesbian embrace on soap opera brookside should not be shown until later in the evening but when the bailey review was published a month later it made no such recommendations and its authors admirably emphasised that all sexualities should be treated equally this nonexistent unproposed gaylesbian tv kiss ban became one of the tabloids recurring riffs over this summers silly season despite everyone involved pointing out that the story was complete nonsense on a stick in the yougov survey the gay women kissing question threw up some surprising statistics most brilliantly among those aged it appears lesbian kisses are the most acceptable of all while married couples kissing are the least acceptable kids today eh verily theres is a world turned upside down scotland appeared to be the least tolerant region surveyed only approved of showing a gay male kiss before the watershed against a british average of but scottish people were the least likely to disapprove of gay kissing fullstop and take note fancy cosmopolitan london was the second least accepting of prewatershed gay kissing while that supposed bastion of unreconstructed masculinity the north was the most accepting of manly gayishness by far okayed it before the watershed im not too sure what any of this means beyond in the immortal words of lee scratch perry people funny boy me ive long been arguing for a ban on humans being shown doing anything at all on the tellybox lest anyone has to explain to the kids where they all come

yesterday i was informed by the general teaching council this week that i would be permitted to return to teaching a pleasant surprise after the increasing controversy about my persona in july i was suspended from the school where i used to work as head of personal social and health education after the authorities discovered that i also earned money for stripping in clubs and acting in porn films while i disagree with any sanction being imposed i am content and satisfied that it is a fair decision under the circumstances i believe the gtcs decision is a recognition of the strength of the arguments that i raised to challenge the view that activities in adult entertainment might undermine public trust and confidence in people working in the teaching profession my defence hinged on a number of factors some disputable some indisputable first is the impact of pornography on our society really as damaging as some want us to believe had i not been raised by two openminded parents and not worked in sex education and the sex industry i might have shared the view of those who associate porn with social ills paedophilia rape sex slavery abuse hiv teen sex the degradation of women but i dont think we should accept a view just because it is held by a large number of people there is no evidence to prove pornography has either a negative or for that matter a positive effect on society there are scraps of research but no proof at all millions of men and women legally purchase view and enjoy pornography as a form of entertainment every day the vast majority of these people are decent lawabiding individuals pornography in its simplest form and i accept that there are unsavoury parts of the industry including the exploitation of women and men but then there are unsavoury aspects in most industries is about the depiction of a legally consenting adult having sex with another legally consenting adult or more why should numbers matter what in essence is wrong with that process anyone under the age of viewing pornography in the uk is doing so illegally i would not condone them doing so however i do not see that viewing sexual intercourse or witnessing nudity poses any threat or danger to that child if anything exposure to the realities of sex and nudity and living in a society where we are happy to discuss such issues openly makes for a safer and healthier environment for young people sex and pornography are shrouded in a veil of mystery in britain if young people have access to the same levels of online pornography as our european counterparts which they do why do we have the highest rate of teenage pregnancy and the highest rates of stis in europe my view is that its not because of exposure to depictions of sex but because we are not open enough particularly compared with our dutch scandinavian and german neighbours when we refuse to talk about something in public young people are more inclined to experiment in private and to do so without the adequate tools to make informed choices telling young people that sex is always bad wrong and immoral is simply not an adequate response our society is faced with hypocrisies and inconsistencies the riots up and down our great land only served to demonstrate this we didnt need the recent riots and the subsequent punishments to be reminded of that but my case also shows that some people wish to take a hardline approach on an activity that poses no proven threat to society whatsoever while a teacher working in the sex industry must be banned teachers who publicly indulge in activities that are linked to thousands of deaths each and every year such as smoking drinking and overeating are tolerated prior to the ban being imposed in i worked in a school where smoking was sanctioned by the provision of a smoking room how many deaths are associated with tobacco i have worked in a school that provided alcohol at events attended by parents and students how much misery is linked to alcohol i have worked with a member of the catholic clergy who provided lessons on contraception during the week and told his congregation that contraception was wrong and evil at the weekend how many deaths of aids sufferers around the world can be laid at the hands of the catholic faith when it comes to porn and our society we desperately need to start putting things into perspective porn is going nowhere we had better learn to deal with it in a grownup way and young people arent machines that we can indoctrinate with our irrational fears and prejudices they are too clever for that this article

half of all women who are victims of domestic violence will no longer qualify for legal aid under government proposals leaving hundreds of thousands at greater risk of abuse according to charities ben jamal chief executive of the charity domestic violence intervention project said analysis of their case files indicated that of women victims would lose out despite david camerons identification of the issue as a priority experts say the governments proposed legal reforms run contrary to its pledges to tackle domestic violence the home office action plan to end violence against women promises to provide adequate support where violence does occur and take action to reduce the risk to women and girls who are victims three million women a year experience violence in britain a significant proportion of them domestic abuse according to the government yet a coalition of specialists and womens rights groups say that proposals in the legal aid sentencing and punishment of offenders bill which has a third reading in the commons this week will seriously undermine its strategy on reducing violence against women emma scott of campaign group rights of women said the planned reforms to save m a year in legal aid would have a devastating and disproportionate impact on women she added in his press conference announcing the legal aid bill david cameron said that he wanted families to feel safe in their own homes yet it will leave many at greater risk of violence and abuse trapped in violent and abusive relationships and at greater risk of post separation violence the reforms demonstrate a total lack of awareness and understanding of the dynamics and nature of domestic violence and the experiences of women affected by it officially the governments position is that legal aid will be available to victims of domestic violence but groups point to the governments decision to effectively change the definition of domestic violence by upping the type of evidence required to substantiate allegations making it harder to qualify for legal representation under the proposals only women who can prove a high risk of violence such as having secured a conviction against their perpetrator or have been referred for a risk assessment will be eligible for legal aid they will put legal aid for family cases out of scope for the majority of women who have experienced violence and abuse said scott jamal added officially the government says one thing but in reality they have drawn down the definition so narrowly that significant numbers of women are no longer eligibleexperts argue that other evidence including gp records call outs social services and information from housing agencies should also be allowed jamal also warned that alleged perpetrators will lose legal aid

november will see the premiere of pan am on bbc it is a softfocus drama series bought from america about the adventures of a group of pan am stewardesses in the s it is all big hair and pouting with a preposterous photogenicstewardessasciaoperative subplot to distract the viewer from the fact that pan am is all about big hair and pouting a reductive and submissive fantasy with working women as eye candy and explicitly in the first episode as sex aid even so they are represented as empowered because they are beautiful and get on and off aeroplanes it is remarkably similar to virgin atlantic airlines repulsive th anniversary advert of which shows a group of bighaired pouting virgin stewardesses wafting through an airport terminal like women who forgot to get dressed outside the terminal meanwhile newspapers scream about the miners strike but you can forget the proper politics because it does not exist in this glittering shagscape when the plane eventually takes off it has a seminaked woman painted on the front wrapped up in a british flag because her seminudity is a patriotic act we are not even in is long gone we are in still red hot says the tagline yuck i mention this as last week at the fawcett societys annual agm i pondered why the feminist movement seems so comprehensively to have stalled feminism seems so tiny today so niche of such little interest to the outside world and even to women and yet it is needed the facts are bewildering or depressing depending on ones mental state in the uk the pay gap of will not shift when the chartered management institute cmi polled male and female executives in the private sector last year they learned the average pay gap between men and women doing the same job is and the average woman will as such be cheated out of in her lifetime which is a lot for a feminist and also for a consumer the glass ceiling is still bulletproof men outnumber women in parliament by four to one and there are more millionaires than women in the cabinet and it shows women who do make it into politics are mocked and debased alongside camerons cuties and blairs babes we now have millies fillies a fine headline for the fact that there are now women in the shadow cabinet to ed milibands credit the cuts as this newspaper has detailed will affect women who are the nations carers and who tend to work in the public sector far more than men because childcare responsibilities still fall on women women with children take lowpaid opportunityfree parttime work and suffer economically and presumably spiritually meanwhile after a summer when single mothers were blamed for the riots abortion rights are still routinely questioned and it is now quite normal for editorials to denounce women for seeking to abort as murderers after the agm i went to a birthday party and told others where i had been i listened to men and women tell me how much they hate harriet harman the woman who pushed the equality act although in a neutered form through parliament and was abused for her trouble see rod liddles columns particularly the one where he called caroline flint fit as a butchers dog although i am probably not meant to mention it again it being old news so i am a bad sport that was their comment on modern feminism an indistinct halfimagined dislike for harriet harman although they cannot remember why and i decided then that i lay the blame for the stalling of the feminist movement almost entirely at the door of the media the fawcett society and its concerns will almost never make it into the mainstream media some things as i have learned in almost years in journalism are just not a story until they explode the media seems to have reinvented itself not as a source of information but escapism a oneway conversation with your own internal idiot in this world an octopus called paul who can predict the results of the world cup is a story even if he cannot actually predict the results of the world cup because he is an octopus and is probably above such things add squirrels on waterskis obese rabbits dogs that can use cashpoints and who knows semipoliticised fish and you have a genre of the media that is probably bigger and is certainly more profitable than the section that cares about feminism you can dream of a fair comprehensive and balanced article about the equality act but you will not get it even if paul the octopus offered to write it with one of his many arms nor will a piece about the achievements of women in politics get through millies fillies will cut it off at the knees and we can all fall about laughing at the presumption of these women the media still uses the ridiculous term career woman even though there is no such thing as a career man instead of debate what we have are articles about how women bosses are evil especially to er women and how women who work hate themselves because their children turn feral without a cath kidstonwrapped maniac in the kitchen statistics are rare statistics are too boring to print instead the media acts as a marketing tentacle for the beauty and fashion industries no friend to women merely selling the lie that purchase is a feminist act because in the words of the loreal slogan were worth it yes we are and that is why i do not dye my hair in fact shopping is the only feminist act still possible in the media world because they think consumerism is feminism buy and feel good about yourself even as you get into debt for your trouble and forget that actually you looked ok in your old clothes with your old hair and with your old vagina it also due to its emphasis on shopping mistakes what a feminist is two current tv heroes mary portas and kirsty allsop could be interpreted as feminists because they have both their own tv shows in fact they are not feminists but saleswomen as committed to female dissatisfaction buy a house buy a dress buy anything as anyone in sales celebrity is no friend to feminism either even if angelina jolie once made a statement that could be reasonably divined as feminist i have no idea if she did make such a statement but it is possible because she had to starve sweat and be surgically enhanced to be in a position to make it and be heard sex and the city is an ok conduit for a discussion of feminism because it contains shoes without the sex and the city peg you will get nowhere i suppose celebritys contribution to feminism is if you are hot enough you will be heard but hurry up because you wont be hot for long my serious advice to the fawcett society as it prepares for its day

women could soon have the right to know whether a new partner has a history of domestic violence under proposed legislation announced by the home secretary theresa may the home office has launched a consultation over how a national domestic violence disclosure scheme could work in practice following a campaign by the father of clare wood who was strangled in by an exboyfriend she had met through facebook unknown to her her murderer george appleton had three previous convictions under the antistalking protection from harassment act and had kidnapped a previous girlfriend at knifepoint may said she was interested in introducing what has been called clares law adding that ending violence against women and girls was a priority for her and the government clares law carries echoes of sarahs law the legislation under which parents in england have the right to ask police whether someone who has regular contact with their child is on the sex offenders register domestic violence is a particularly dreadful form of abuse and i want us to constantly look at new ways of protecting victims and preventing tragic incidents from happening may said the move was partly by the decision of hazel blears the former labour minister and the local mp of the wood familys local mp to table an amendment to the sentencing and punishment bill when it returns to the house of commons for its report stage next week blears has backed the campaign waged by clares father michael brown saying women in clares position rarely know they are at risk from men like appleton despite his record of systematic domestic violence against different women she had no way of knowing that he posed such a threat information about his violent and vicious past was known to the authorities but she was left in the dark the police already have common law powers to disclose information on an individuals previous convictions or charges to the public in cases where there is a clear need to prevent further crime the home office consultation paper suggests three options the status quo a right to ask national disclosure scheme and a right to know national disclosure scheme the righttoask scheme would mirror sarahs law

several of the larger feminist websites got a little bit excited last week about a new psychology paper entitled men women and the bedroom science confirms what feminists have been saying forever declared feministing triumphantly all those myths about innate gender differences when it comes to sex not actually true university of michigan psychologist terri conley and her team were the academics responsible and they are quite explicit about their intention they say they wish to challenge popular perceptions within psychology and among the greater public that gender differences in sexuality are immutable and largely unaffected by the proximal social environment in other words this is the latest volley in a longrumbling intellectual battle between feminist theory and evolutionary psychology despite the claims of feministing this is far from a nail in the coffin of gender essentialism conley et al bring up six commonly held myths about male and female sexuality and look for contradictory evidence in the literature two of the myths they argue can be disproved the other four are true so not actually myths at all but to a lesser extent than commonly imagined for example the myth that men think about sex more than women is confirmed yes they do about times a day as opposed to for women but men also think more about their other physical needs too such as food and sleep the authors point out that this is in keeping with models of socialisation where females are raised to worry about the needs of others more than their own it might be but it could also be that men and women have evolved different innate instincts towards nurturing altruism and selfinterest one could raise similar objections to each of the claims made in the paper but perhaps the broader issue is that there are only six of them this is not a systematic literature review evolutionary psychologists have found literally dozens of gender differences in sexual behaviours and we must assume these six were selected because they were the ones most easily challenged it is easy to understand why feminists are suspicious of evolutionary psychology the idea that human behaviour and character is determined by our genes has been used to justify all kinds of ills from racism and slavery to eugenics and patriarchal social structures it has been hard enough for women to win rights to independence without men in white coats claiming that it is more natural for them to stay home with the cooker and the kids it is also true that a huge amount of duff science has been published under the banner of evolutionary psychology much of it justifiably dismissed as speculative nonfalsifiable theories claims that women have naturally evolved to prefer the colour pink that black women are innately less attractive or that men have evolved to fancy slimmer women tend to be media misrepresentations or deliberate provocations and should be laughed off the page however while any specific claim about the genetic basis of a particular human behaviour can be found wanting the general principle at stake that our brains and instinctive traits have been shaped by evolutionary principles and will in some ways be different for men and women is pretty much indisputable in criticising evolutionary psychology feminists are often pushing at an open door no serious academic believes that all human thought and behaviour is programmed by our genes david buss might be called the high priest of modern evolutionary psychology and has worked extensively and controversially on human mating behaviour earlier this year he penned the introduction to a special issue of the journal sex roles which was overtly conciliatory towards feminism explaining why human behaviour is not and cannot be genetically determined at best this debate is about the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors not their existence but psychologists and neuroscientists are increasingly realising that the distinction between the two is far from clear human beings shape the environment in which we live our lived experiences shape our brains known as neuroplasticity and then our brains influence how we shape our environment as cordelia fine explains in delusions of gender even the genetic code is an unhelpful guide to our behaviour as different genes and groups of genes are triggered into action by environmental factors we might have a whole bunch of genes that came in handy on the savanna but that doesnt mean theyre particularly influential on our behaviour today fundamentally what conley et al are claiming does seem to be true gender differences in sexuality are not immutable and are certainly affected by the social environment theyre also remarkably small in a recent

siri the digital pa on apples latest iphone is female in the us and male in the uk apple has declined to comment on the reasoning behind this but theories abound stephen ebbett of gadget insurer protectyourbubblecom says apple has decided that brits trust an authoritative male voice while americans traditionally favour and are more receptive to a female voice last week an editor at washingtonbased atlantic magazine rebecca rosen studied the gender politics of robots she concluded that when technology uses a voice to guide us through phone messages or on public transport it tends to be female anything more active or cerebral is usually male for manufacturers working out the sex of technology is a complicated business and one that unearths our prejudices professor clifford nass of stanford university an authority on the humantechnology interface said in the toronto star that people respond to robotic gender just as they do to human gender with deeper voices considered more intelligent and credible he worked at bmw in the s when it recalled navigation systems with a female voice drivers who were mostly male didnt want to take directions from a female so does the ubiquity of female gps voices mean the situation has improved or is it because womens voices are thought to be more calming reverting to the women as carers men as doers paradigm returning to apples siri jeremy wagstaff who runs technology consultancy loose wire organisation says americans speak loudly and clearly and are usually in a hurry so it makes sense for them to have a female voice because it

ralph richard banks a stanford professor is the latest to attempt to cash in on the single black woman fearmongering that has been so popular in the media for the last two years one that has lead to countless articles comedianfronted nightline panels and a hilarious round of lets blame the black church most recently hes in the economist peddling the same song black women have been hearing for years a combination of stop being so picky date interracially stop dating out of their class level which is a reversal from older advice that black women should be open to dating bluecollar men and marriage is the solution to most problems the economist article even provides a frightening chart on falling black marriage rates but it doesnt provide an accurate picture of the dating environment first of all black women are hardly the only women currently reevaluating marriage the atlantic has spent the last year documenting the changes in attitudes about rings and other shiny things historically speaking marriage has been defined to mean what people need it to mean from a way to secure economic security and partnership to a public declaration of love in times of slavery black women did want to be married but the main focus was on creating a stable family unit official or otherwise more contemporary battles over marriage revolve around the changing needs of citizens particularly those in samesex relationships or those with nontraditional families and who said marriage is still the ultimate end goal as samhita mukopadhyay author of outdated why dating is ruining your love life told me all of this conjecture about the failure rates of marriage is based on the assumption that all black women want to get married there is so much talk about how it is impacting their lives but no one puts anything into studying what they actually wantneedfeel not surprisingly black women are lectured to about their love lives not engaged in conversation if we accept the premise that black women arent doing well in the general dating market there are other welldocumented reasons for some of these gaps dating isnt exactly a bastion of political correctness back in wendi muse documented the environment over at craiglist noting that stereotypes were in full effect in the world of online dating where a user name masked email address and optional photo sharing means freedom to speak ones mind in complete anonymity users frequently abandon political correctness and resort to exotification stereotypes and blatant racism when referring to racialethnic others in their attempts to choose a mate popular dating site okcupid routinely crunches data about their users looking at everything from the biggest lies in online dating to the best questions for a first date one has to take their findings with a pinch of salt but back in they made a stir by breaking down the information on response rates by race the response was familiar to any black person who has attempted online dating men dont write black women back or rather they write them back far less often than they should black women reply the most yet get by far the fewest replies essentially every race including other blacks singles them out for the cold shoulder to be fair black men also had a similarly low response rate but to imply that black women being closedminded is the reason for the current state of affairs is grossly simplifying the complex politics of attraction particularly in societies that value some types of beauty more highly than others this leads me to my final pet peeve regarding socalled relationship experts in their quest to sell books and make media appearances they bulldoze the individual nature of the mating game in the rush to diagnose millions of people with the same problem the truth is there are many reasons why people find themselves single sometimes its their own attitudes but many other times the timing just isnt right their careers are too demanding or they need to focus elsewhere as a black woman who has been in a committed relationship for five years nothing is more obvious to me than how random circumstance plays a major role in many happy relationships if i hadnt missed a concert i wouldnt know my boyfriend if one of my friends hadnt gone to mali with the peace corps she would have never been on the same continent as her nowhusband if another friend hadnt missed her original train and hadnt been wearing a sweatshirt from her alma mater she would have never met the man she would marry dating love and marriage are far more complicated than selfproclaimed experts would have us believe statistics can show all kinds of trends but ultimately life liberty and the pursuit of happiness in a relationship is the province of each

today the women of the year lunch takes place in london there will be more than women from all walks of life and from all over the country in one room making more noise than you would think possible it will be exhilarating and uplifting yet people ask why we still have an allwomens event like this and why since i am not exactly a woman who lunches i am the president of such a retro occasion the answer is simple the world has not shifted on its axis a lot has happened in my adult life to improve the lot of women but not enough has changed we still need to take stock of the reality of many womens lives with low pay domestic violence rape poor education and a lack of opportunity still blighting the chances of so many we have to remind ourselves of what women achieve but also what still has to be done you only have to look around the globe at the position of women and the suffering that they endure to recognise that we still have a distance to travel to achieve genuine equality one of my own public roles in the past year has been to chair an inquiry into human trafficking as a human rights lawyer i thought i knew all there was to know about cruelty and inhumanity towards women but this investigation has shown me abuse at another level organised and professionalised one part of the seething underbelly of globalisation and spreading like a virus throughout the world but our hearts are also soothed by the great stories of womens triumphs over adversity so many of the women who are nominated to come to the lunch and then chosen are there because they have turned some horrible blow to good use they experience cancer and then set up a survivors support group they lose a husband in war and raise funds for his wounded colleagues they have a disabled child and fight for better facilities for all children with that disability then there are the women who see a wrong and have to right it one of the women coming today lived on a hellish housing estate where drug abuse and crime were rife she set to work organising the community to take on the problems liaising with police and social services and turned the place around she was nominated by all the people in the neighbourhood also there are women who inspire us all because they have succeeded in worlds that have been dominated by men they have risen in their field and shown our daughters that it can be done you can be a senior politician or a leading scientist we need to celebrate our role models and we must also laud the women at the top who do not hoard their success but use it to help others the lunch also celebrates those fearless extraordinary women who fight for freedom and democracy and make huge sacrifices for their people sometimes facing exile or imprisonment today the egyptian doctor novelist and champion of women dr nawal el saadawi who led the revolutionary movement in tahrir square during the arab spring will be among the winners when joan armatrading persuaded me to follow her

three years ago i read on comment is free about the launch of a new muslim marriage contract the contract would change the face of british muslim family life it would confirm and reestablish the islamic rights for women upon entering marriage that some cultures had blurred along the way the contract which was relaunched this summer does away with a lot of old cultural baggage it stresses loyalty mutuality and equality between husband and wife protects the wifes financial rights and points out that there is no obligation for a bride to live with her inlaws it goes further as someone who is determinedly independent it baffled me why i should need a wali a male guardian to grant his official permission for me to marry before my consent was asked id come to accept that was just the way it was but the new contract confirms that in islam a woman of adult age doesnt need a wali she can declare her own intention to marry without someone elses official permission being given first like most muslims id also assumed that witnesses to the nikah the muslim marriage always had to be men but the new contract states that islamic law only says a witness to marriage should be a sane responsible adult with no conditions on gender or faith meaning women and nonmuslims can be witnesses too to me this new marriage contract was symbolic it gave recognition and respect to british muslim women of my generation and to british muslim couples too so reading about the contract in i vowed that the day i would get married i would marry under this contract and sign my name to the rights my religion afforded me fast forward three years and my wedding day is nearly here in three weeks time i will be signing my civil ceremony papers as well as my nikah contract my fiance and i read the contract through online since my father had passed away and a wali wasnt necessary anyway we wanted my mother to be a witness for the nikah i felt it was meaningful respectful and reflective of our close relationship for her to play a key part in our marriage proceedings and hoped to set a positive precedence among our family and friends we dont know anyone who has married under this new contract my fiance in particular felt strongly about setting an example by including a female witness we also thought that it would be nice to include one of my fiances parents hes a convert to islam as the second witness so that theyd be involved in the muslim ceremony too but it hasnt turned out that way we asked the imam at our mosque in regents park for his thoughts he hadnt heard of the contract i emailed him a copy along with links to the comment is free pieces explaining the changes and the islamic basis for them he said that it was probably best if my mother wasnt a witness and concluded without providing any religious basis for it that it was better if both witnesses were muslim my mum who felt touched to be a witness asked family friends for their opinion the overwhelming majority said my marriage contract would be void if i a didnt have a wali and b had my mother as a witness they said we should do it the way its done the doctor who is conducting our islamic marriage it doesnt have to be overseen by an imam says my fiances father can be a witness but that my mum probably shouldnt be he also says i need a wali no one we have talked to has even heard of the new muslim marriage contract the muslim institute took four years of extensive and careful islamic research to come up with the marriage contract seeking clarification between cultural assumptions and religious facts its been endorsed by the muslim parliament of great britain the muslim law council the imam amp mosques council and the muslim womens network so surely if the contract wasnt islamically valid then none of these bodies would have put their weight behind it but the muslim institutes good and hard work seems to have achieved little despite investing in a website and relaunch this summer its astonishing and disappointing that so few people appear to have even heard of the new contract those my mum my fiance and i have spoken to seem reluctant nervous and wary to embrace something which isnt in line with what has always been its in turn made my mum now feel anxious over signing the new contract too which means shes decided not to follow through some people will think my fiance and i have been fussing over nothing that a signature is just a signature if thats the case if its really not that big a deal then why not just let my mum sign the papers my future fatherinlaw will be my fiances witness my fiance feels frustrated that weve given up trying to prove a point that things will never change if no one takes the first step that its the principle of it as for including my mum well theres still the civil ceremony where at least uk law will validate her gender as a witness without it being subjected to debate,2011-10,three year ago read comment free launch new muslim marriage contract contract would change face british muslim family life would confirm reestablish islamic right woman upon entering marriage culture blurred along way contract wa

there has been much recent speculation about the conservatives losing support among women voters this may explain why david cameron yesterday took an initiative on one of the few issues on which opinion polling reveals a sharp gender divide women are stronger supporters of curbs on internet pornography than men are and women are also more likely to want restrictions on sexual music videos and advertising especially when directed at children both issues duly featured in the prime ministers downing street seminar on the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood at which mr cameron also backed the new parentport website on which parents can raise issues and anxieties about inappropriate media treatment of and pressure on children mr cameron is right to give these issues some priority his approach contrasts with that of the previous government which stood by during the expansion of online pornography access in this country without ever lifting a finger to do anything about it labour was scared of having a fight for which the coalition has shown more readiness with the internet service providers the government is not just in tune with public opinion nearly twothirds of voters including of women want to see internet pornography blocked it is also doing the right thing the internets many benefits were never intended to include the bombarding of peoples homes and children by pornography and spam to an unprecedented degree meanwhile the destructive effects of pornography on relationships and values harming not just children but also adults far exceed any liberating effect which some claim to discern yet mr camerons measures do not go far enough the decision by the main internet service providers to require new customers to make a positive online choice in favour of access to unsuitable content is a step forward but it is not a very large step it leaves all existing customers unaffected so the impact is likely to be extremely limited it is also a slow step which gives the isps until the end of to introduce the new filtering system mr cameron has also done little to respond constructively to president sarkozys call this year for coordinated action on what is a truly global phenomenon the anxiety to avoid improper or excessive interference with consumer freedom is laudable so is the wish to work with rather than against the isps these are the right reflexes but so is a refusal to be indifferent to the fact and the scale of internet pornography and so is the determination to protect childhood and to support good relationships there should be no shame in trying to put the wonders of the internet to better uses than we do at present,2011-10,ha much recent speculation conservative losing support among woman

to no ones surprise it has been announced that the prime minister david cameron will meet four big internet providers to discuss optin schemes for internet porn in other words websites flagged as adult or objectionable content will be blocked unless you say you want to see it if youre a customer with one of the big internet providers expect to be sending them a copy of your id in the not so distant future the impetus for this meeting is the bailey sexualisation consultation report from this summer the report was notable in that it relied uncritically on the evidence supposedly offered in the previous governments consultation headed by linda papadopoulos the new report recommended that if no changes were made by isps in the following months the government should step in and enforce its own standards its apparently on this basis then that the isps have agreed to changes proposed by cameron and the mothers union however there are conflicting reports about how onmessage their involvement really is what the claims about the effects of hypersexualisation have not demonstrated is a causeandeffect relationship when you look at the problems most people fear such as increased sexual activity the evidence isnt there additionally reports such as the one produced by the scottish executive show most children actually have a more balanced and mature approach to imagery than commentators give them credit for when it comes to proof that sexualised media cause harmful effects the only honest response is we dont know i may be banging an extremely unfashionable drum but is it acceptable to limit the media choices of adults based on assumptions about children that have never been proven many are understandably concerned about the governments endorsement of this plan i had an inadvertent insight into how optin systems work this year my mobile provider only allows access to adult websites on phone browsing by optin and theres an extra access charge of course so when the daily mail inadvertently illustrated a story with an image that for a few hours included a screenshot with visible porn on it i was surprised to find i could view this on my phone the mail amended the image a few hours later but not before it had done the rounds on twitter meanwhile a friends sex education website which features no explicit imagery was blocked with some in the adult industry struggling to survive the recession you might think they would embrace opting in to adult entertainment after all opting in implies a way of identifying consumers and their media habits doesnt it but talking to people in the industry they dont agree the proposals are being made without any input from the people who make the content internet providers will charge more to access anything adult money that wont be passed on to the contents creators and isps dont have a good record on stopping illegal distribution and copyright infringement on twitter tim arrowsmith husband of feminist porn director anna span called on isps to use their power not to restrict access but to stop content theft and protect british jobs to those who are also concerned about the welfare of people in adult entertainment consider this surely it makes sense to help keep us and uk producers in business because they comply with american child protection laws regarding age and consent if the government and the isps really do have any power when it comes to adult entertainment why are they not using it to promote more ethical standards what optin does do is make the government appear to be doing something and potentially provide a nice little earner for the likes of sky and bt when it comes to sex and sexualisation the issues do not lend themselves to quick fixes and easy answers optin sounds good to some but the questions it raises about evidence and about rights and ethics are worth a deeper look,2011-10,one surprise ha announced prime minister david cameron meet four big internet provider discus

a study funded by the nspcc into teenage domestic abuse shows that over of disadvantaged young women have been in violent relationships before their th birthday and children as young as are being physically emotionally and sexually abused in their relationships yet we still dont know how many young people are victimised each day but dont tell a soul assaulted in the shadows the private violence they experience influences their relationships with family their choices their health and many agencies struggle to know how to respond domestic violence is defined as taking place in a relationship between two adults the historical legacy of this has seen the development of refuges independent domestic violence advocates and risk assessment structures designed to keep women safe creating conditions for them to leave relationships safely and regain control of their lives this progress for women has been essential and rightly continues to seek investment and improvement to save and improve lives but what of the violence that takes place in teenage relationships we are yet to create conditions for girls to regain control and leave violent relationships safely women need to leave homes girls relationships take place in their schools in their peer groups in their neighbourhoods how do they leave these behind professionals may be more aware that genderbased violence affects teenage as well as adult relationships but support for specialist responses have not followed this awareness constraining the choices that girls make and leaving them without the protection they desperately need over the past three years awareness that gangrelated violence affects girls has increased dramatically when i first started interviewing girls associated with gangs the policy landscape was practically void of references to females and lacked acknowledgment that girls may be in danger fast forward to and gang injunction guidance contains a specific chapter on young women and references are made to gangaffected young women in plans to tackle violence against women yet when girls are seeking to exit gangassociation or relationships with gang members we havent yet devised a gendered strategy to safely remove girls from such highrisk situations when a woman chooses to leave a violent relationship her decision is influenced by many things including the belief that refuges provide a safe haven without this safety net how many would choose to leave when people are the victims of crime they come forward to the police to be protected to protect others and to seek justice if they didnt believe this would be the outcome would they choose to report one yearold girl said to me my boyfriend broke my nose when i was and no one helped no one has ever helped how

support for the tories among women is in decline with just saying in a recent poll that they feel the conservative party is the one closest to women after david camerons speech what impression are women being left with about the party anna bird acting chief executive of the fawcett society the prime minister claims the most important workers right of all is having a job in the first place but the coalitions policies are forcing women out of the workplace more than a million women are now out of work the highest figure since while a record half a million are claiming jobseekers allowance as public sector budgets are further squeezed these figures are only going to get worse of the public sector workforce is female cameron says those with the most money are bearing the biggest burden but research clearly shows this simply isnt the case looking just at changes to welfare it is single mums who are going to lose the biggest proportion of their income an average of an entire months income by june osullivan chief executive of the london early years foundation i loved the idea that david cameron will help us unleash the kind of entrepreneurial leadership that will free us up for growth and give the country the kind of ambitious childcare and family support for those who need it most nothing but the best for all children but even more so for poor children he took the words out of my mouth roll on the freedom and support to make it happen justine roberts cofounder of mumsnet lets face it the speech had some good lines and the pm delivers them better than most getting tory conference to applaud gay marriage and foreign aid takes some doing promise of the reform of the adoption system sounded sensible too but did he do anything for the skilled female workers who have turned their backs on the tories in the polls there was a fleeting reference to this government being the most familyfriendly ever but uk parents spend more of their income on childcare than anywhere else in the world if so many hadnt lost their jobs and benefits maybe there wouldnt be quite such need for the pms promised relationship support i rather think camerons dog whatever its size is barking up the wrong tree jo tanner former tory aide now founder of hersay a female polling company david cameron needed to reconnect with women this week but can one politician ever truly connect with such a complex diverse audience in one speech after a significant focus on foreign affairs and the world economy david cameron took minutes to highlight familyfriendly policies on childcare and health services the growing number of female entrepreneurs will be heartened by his support for small business references to supporting the police and parental responsibility will be welcomed melissa cooke independent facilitator the thing that jumped out of me from the speech was his statement on fairness the balance between what we put in and take out and i think that many of us feel that that balance is still out of kilter women often still do the lions share of unpaid work so placing more value on that is extremely relevant for us overall the conservatives are trying lay out a vision that relies on so many people playing a small part to catalyse change at a time of crisis we cannot rely on goodwill alone but i think hes right about leadership being able to unleash things in people the question for cameron is how do we better unleash the leadership talents of women to help achieve this he talked about a focus on parenting and childcare but with a lot of women work in the public sector they are feeling the pain with job cuts and pay freezes and that might be why certain sections feel its just unfair the other thing that came out for me was about vested interests whos vested interests is it for women to be kept out of the boardroom and to struggle to get back into work after doing good things like raising children lady jenkin conservative member of the house of lords it helps to look and sound prime ministerial and david cameron does after a couple of quite good jokes at the expense of ken clarke mog the cat he roamed around the world before starting to push my buttons as chair of the newly launched conservative friends of international development i particularly welcome his recommitment of support for the worlds poorest i liked his emphasis on the family especially his announcement about making it easier to adopt babies in care i was a bit surprised by the enthusiastic welcome in the hall for his brave announcement about gay marriage his focus on discipline and standards in schools was good as was his encouragement of private schools to set up academies all round a strong competent performance leaving the audience with the feeling of hope that he understands the current difficulties and challenges and will lead us all to sunnier uplands,2011-10,support tory among woman decline saying recent poll feel conservative party one closest woman

sixty tories and not a testicle between them was the way jeremy paxman chose to introduce a newsnight debate on david camerons declining support among women taking a bunch of conservative women two tory mps and a columnist who writes shriek for the guardian seemed a bit onesided but what was most depressing about the debate was what it said about the way we discuss women and politics here are the arguments held by women who believe things are nowhere near as bad as those mendacious polls would have us believe and that women love david cameron and his uxorious ways women are not all the same childcare is not just a womens issue and its outrageous that there are no men here discussing this issue there was also the woman who said we should all just get a sense of humour and keep calm and in theresa mays inimitable words im not making that up we may support these views to a greater or lesser extent but what none of them do is actually tackle the issue support for the coalition has fallen to among women lower than for men in the past year as i wrote in an earlier post evidence of collapsing support is greatest among the female c vote skilled manual or clerical workers many of whom work in the public sector the reasons for this seem pretty clear public sector jobs are being hit hardest in the recession and women tend to depend more on the benefits and services childcare costs and sure start for example that are being cut tim montgomerie the founder of conservative home pointed out that margaret thatchers three convincing majorities were built on the womens vote is it little wonder that cameron who has not managed to win one convincing majority should be so concerned yet listening to the women in the newsnight studio on tuesday evening anyone would think this is an argument dreamed up by rabid feminists probably writing blogs for the guardian jenni russell did make a valiant effort to mention that it wasnt ab voters nor typically female tory mps who were the cause of the problem but was shouted down not as far as i could tell by the woman who said cameron and his team ticked her box so lets deal with the first entirely reasonable argument that women are not all the same most people care about the same issues jobs and the cost of living health education crime its not as if men are all sitting there thinking about top gear and rio ferdinand is it differences of opinion are more likely to be based on age class occupation and geography than sex according to resolution foundation which wrote the research so vexing cameron but that isnt to say that just because a few women stand up to say no really im much happier baking cakes and going shopping than voting or variations thereof the behaviour of our prime minister isnt an issue worth discussing the next point is just as hoary and i will annoy people on the left as well as the right by saying it yes men do care about childcare and in my household and those of many of my friends men do their fair share of the household chores and parenting the point is that large tracts of evidence and surveys suggest that it is women who largely deal with childcare giving up work to do it or managing those who do it instead thus cuts to childcare benefits and services hit them hardest particularly those who dont have a partner at all let alone a supportive one and yes i know there are singleparent dads just nowhere near as many when charlotte vere a prospective candidate used her spot in the bbc limelight to say how outrageous it was that there were no men to discuss the issue i actually laughed out loud not because i dont believe in men and women debating such an issue but newsnight along with most serious news programmes is always criticised for the lack of female representation statistically women are more likely to appear as victims of crime than as experts on news programmes then when a bunch of women are gathered together they demand more men for balance its too easy to become party political here just look at the newsnight hashtag on twitter to see the divided opinion with those outraged at the stepfordwives on display contrasting with those suggesting women were wimps to complain but the way the debate degenerated into an unedifying squabble was worthy of more debate it might have been better if stephanie flanders kirsty wark or mishal husain had taken over from paxman on the night i cant imagine them telling a panellist to be quiet in the same way but what was really at issue were the attitudes to women and politics it showed the last word was left to a woman who pointed out that young women earn more than their male counterparts and we should just wait for them to mature just keep calm and it will happen is her advice theyve been saying that about real equality for a while though,2011-10,sixty tory testicle wa way jeremy paxman chose introduce newsnight debate david camerons declining support among woman taking bunch

there were regular rows when i was a student about women being left out of history a controversy which seems a bit oldfashioned these days but if modern history is unlikely to overlook womens role theres a great deal of the past to catch up on so a new initiative from the west yorkshire archive and huddersfield university is sure to get plenty of use and appreciation it is a website which launches on friday under the title history to herstory the latter a term i remember from past dingdongs when juliet gardiner and then gordon marsden were successively at the helm of the magazine history today she has subsequently done mighty work on the history of everyone in the s and the second world war while marsden is a familiar part of northern life as labour mp for blackpool south since theyre both likely to pay online calls on history to herstory which has free digital versions of more than documents relating to yorkshire women in the th and th centuries this includes such wellknown stars of the county as the bronte sisters and amy johnson but also thousands who currently have no memorial but lead fascinating and illuminating lives funded by jisc formerly the joint information systems committee of leading universities which gave and huddersfield uni which paid the site links every online document to the whereabouts of the original most are at the west yorkshire archive but with substantial contributions from huddersfield and hull universities and the bronte society naturally the organisers are interested in getting more katy goodrum of west yorkshire archives service says we certainly dont want to deprive people of the ability to see the originals but the website means you dont have to travel from half way around the world to use the material the main thing for me is a huge amount of it is in womens own words which is quite rare the notion of the website may be familiar to some researchers because an earlier version was attempted in but worked only clunkily it showed that demand was there however and the archives and huddersfield made a persuasive case for a complete overhaul and reboot they were helped by recent examples of research on womens lives which led to excellent and widely accessible historical work such as jill liddingtons study of the sufragettes rebel girls and the immense interest in anne lister of shibden hall historian prof tim thornton huddersfields provice chancellor for teaching and learning calls the project a great example of bringing underused resources back into the public gaze his colleague dr rob ellis of the unis history department says this is an archive that can be used for many purposes by anybody from academic researchers to family historians and of any age the site includes learning

it doesnt matter how hard i study facebooks terms and conditions i still cant find the bit where it says like humpty dumpty facebook is at complete liberty to interpret the words used in this document in any way it sees fit and yet thats obviously what facebook executives have been doing making words mean what they want them to mean or else theyd have removed the pages that promote rape and other forms of violence against women months ago the specific clause in facebooks statement of rights and responsibilities thats supposed to protect groups against violence and hate speech instructs the user you will not post content that is hateful threatening or pornographic incites violence or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence however facebook has now defended the numerous pages that clearly violate these terms by claiming groups that express an opinion on a state institution or set of beliefs even if that opinion is outrageous or offensive to some do not by themselves violate our policies which is strange because if a page entitled roses are red violets are blue ive got a knife get in the van isnt hateful threatening or gratuitously violent i dont for the life of me know what is it was back in august that feminists first began to notice the proliferation of prorape pages on the popular social networking site two months later over people have signed a usbased petition calling on facebook to take them down and nearly people have signed a ukbased petition calling for the same the facebook pages such as the one cited above and others that include you know shes playing hard to get when your sic chasing her down an alleyway still remain facebooks initial response to the public outcry was to suggest that promoting violence against women was equivalent to telling a rude joke down the pub it is very important to point out that what one person finds offensive another can find entertaining went the bizarre rape apologia just as telling a rude joke wont get you thrown out of your local pub it wont get you thrown off facebook and in some ways theyre right telling a rude joke probably wouldnt get you thrown out of your local pub id suggest however that propping up your local bar while inciting others to rape your mates girlfriend to see if she can put up a fight would not only get you thrown out it would in all likelihood get you arrested as well still at least you could log on once you got home and post your offensive comments on facebook instead safe in the knowledge that they wouldnt do anything about it what facebook and others who defend this pernicious hate speech dont seem to get is that rapists dont rape because theyre somehow evil or perverted or in any way particularly different from than the average man in the street rapists rape because they can rapists rape because they know the odds are stacked in their favour because they know the chances are theyll get away with it and part of the reason rapists get away with it time after time after time is because we live in a society that all but condones rape because we live in a society where its not taken seriously and where posting heinous comments online that promote sexual violence are not treated as hate speech or as content that threatens womens safety but are instead treated as a joke and given a completely free pass by refusing to take these pages down and by resorting to such a ridiculous and quite frankly offensive rude joke analogy to justify their decision facebook executives have made absolutely clear where they stand on the issue of gender hate crime its fine to post hateful or threatening content on their site just as its fine to post content that incites violence well as long as its primarily aimed at women that is this article was commissioned

rape already arouses serious anxiety because so few attacks are reported to the police conviction rates are low and victims are subject to intrusive questioning in court but now concerns are growing that rapists are escaping justice because doctors are failing to properly examine victims or record their injuries depriving police of crucial forensic evidence in other words senior doctors fear that some forensic medical examiners fmes are simply not up to the job examining sexual assault victims requires skill sensitivity and attention to detail according to dr george fernie president of the faculty of forensic and legal medicine he explains they could have bruising to the body or injuries to the genitalia or bruising consistent with being grabbed by the upper arms and held or a woman may have had her legs forced apart the person needs to be carefully examined to ensure you dont miss those injuries and that you take the correct swabs for signs of an assailants dna specialist police doctors or police surgeons as forensic medical examiners are also known look after the victims of crime as well as the health of suspects in custody but fernie is worried at the number of cases in which the forensic doctor has missed injuries failed to take swabs or has not documented their findings fully undermining a prosecution the crown prosecution service tell us that sometimes in a sexual assault case they cant proceed with criminal charges because of poor quality medical evidence says fernie some perpetrators are going free because there isnt enough evidence to prosecute because the examining doctor hasnt done his job right police forces used to employ their own regular medical examiners who were often experienced local gps but dr michael wilks chairman of the british medical associations forensic medicine committee says they are increasingly outsourcing to private firms to save money a policy that has coincided with a drop in standards wilks a forensic physician for both the metropolitan and thames valley forces says we are seeing extreme variation in the quality of the service provided thames valley has its own team of doctors but the met abandoned that system in and instead now contracts with doctors independently it is meant to have fmes on duty across london to deal with offenders and victims health but at night its quite common to only have while fernie also calls this process outsourcing it is in effect privatisation more than half the police forces in england and wales have made that switch he believes outsourcing has perpetuated the fiction that any old doctor will do when it comes to forensic medical examination that has led to a potential lowering of standards when the doctor concerned hasnt the necessary knowledge skills and experience he says delays in treating prisoners are also now sometimes so long that some custody officers send them to the local aampe unit so both offenders and victims can end up paying the price of a system that needs urgent repair the general medical council has investigated complaints against different fmes in the past five years it is a small number but suggests problems are arising in at least some cases where details of the victims injuries help decide if someone is convicted last year the gmc suspended dr edet etop ukpong dan from working for a year after serious errors in his handling of two victims in he was working with a doctors agency called medacs for the local police force in both cases ukpong dan admitted he did not take important swabs or specimens from the victims senior doctors say too many fmes are poorly trained and the gmcs conclusion in this case seems to bear this out the panel has noted that prior to your work with medacs you practised for over years in the field of orthopaedics and therefore had no obvious experience which might be regarded as relevant to the practice of forensic medicine the gmc said given this lack of relevant experience it might be said that your decision to respond to medacs search for fmes was unwise and it might also be wondered why medacs thought it appropriate to employ you in short you were out of your depth dr kameron kader who worked for medacs as an fme in bradford was struck off by the gmc in after he threw into a rubbish bin carrier bags containing records of scores of blood tests statements and the intimate examination of many victims of sex crimes although the records were torn into two or four pieces all the victims were identifiable it was a huge breach of patient confidentiality which the gmc said had the potential for serious harm to a large number of people in april dr imraan jhetam who worked for devon and cornwall constabulary as an fme through medacs received a warning from the gmc over his performance in a sexual assault case including an inadequate examination lack of detailed notes and failure to take the right samples last year dr edward oshinyemi had conditions imposed on his work as a doctor including a ban on working as an fme after the gmc labelled his behaviour in a case involving the alleged sexual assault of a threeyearold girl inadequate inappropriate misleading and dishonest he too worked for medacs dr hisham elbaroudy an exfme is currently facing criminal charges of gross negligence manslaughter over the death of a man in police custody in london in one solution to this problem may be for more sexual assault referral centres specialist centres for victims of rape and sexual attacks says fernie fmes ability to document and interpret injury while working in a sexual assault referral centre which physically may be minor although the consequences can be major must be an advantage,2011-10,rape already arouses serious anxiety attack reported police conviction rate low victim subject intrusive questioning court concern growing rapist escaping justice doctor failing properly examine victim record injury depriving police crucial forensic

one of the tories most senior female politicians opened the annual conference and acknowledged the party had to do more to appeal to different voters lady warsi a cochairman of the conservatives made the plea after the first day of conference was partly dominated by the unlikely spectre of the prime minister saying sorry to women in a sunday newspaper david cameron acknowledged making a terrible mistake and that he had screwed up in the commons by appearing to be sexist towards two female mps on two separate occasions he told the sunday times that he was not one of the lads he said its my fault ive got to do better i totally accept im the one whos got to explain who i am and what im like and what i think what i find frustrating is that im not a sort of all right luv im down at the pub tonight whatever thats not me but obviously ive come across in this way the two incidents for which cameron was apologising were telling angela eagle a labour shadow minister to calm down dear and remarking to nadine dorries one of his backbenchers who was unsuccessfully trying to amend the abortion act that she was extremely frustrated a comment that elicited roars of laughter in an internal downing street memo leaked to the guardian a month ago the government admitted it had a problem with women voters it read we are clear that there are a range of policies we have pursued as a government which are seen as having hit women or their interests disproportionately new policies were proposed including frontloading child benefit to help parents struggling with childcare and lost earnings in their childrens early years the aim was to stem loss of support in the polls in polling commissioned by the resolution foundation and conducted by ipsos mori support for the coalition among female voters in the c socioeconomic group mostly lowskilled workers has fallen by points over the last year yesterday william hague the foreign secretary disputed the idea the conservatives had a problem with women telling a conference event in manchester you only need to look at our highly accomplished wives in her speech opening the conference warsi said winning an outright majority in means we must win in all parts if britain as it is today that means reaching out and connecting and attracting people from every corner of the country and every community it means broadening and widening and deepening our appeal it means weve got to speak to every kind of person from every kind of background that is the challenge david cameron set when he became leader he said its not simply enough to say the door is open we must walk out and welcome new people in in a speech to the conservative policy forum the universities and science minister david willetts emphasised the links between his agenda improving skills and family policy he said that holding down an apprenticeship made an individual more likely to maintain a stable relationship willetts said i asked my officials what we know about the personal circumstances of people who have different types of education and training there is one group who are more likely to be married than any other people who have done

often its the smallseeming stories that are the most significant flashing an unexpected light on a deeper problem david cameron didnt plan to spend the beginning of the tory party conference apologising to women after all his commons ripostes to labours angela eagle calm down dear and the conservative nadine dorries whom he called extremely frustrated titter titter were old hat and hardly a hanging offence with the economy tanking tories in revolt over europe and his own home secretary calling for the human rights act to be ripped up he has other things on his mind yet he did apologise he sounded utterly contrite it was all his fault he had to do better why because he reads the polling and knows just how badly the coalition is faring among women voters yesterday he tried to explain this away as being caused by the governments necessary cuts which women struggling with family budgets noticed first that may be part of the picture but as cameron well knows theres a lot more to it than that the gap is now really quite big in the guardians september icm poll there was a modest labour lead among men against for the tories but a much larger one among women to if you look at women over the gap is even more dramatic last year a survey for age uk showed of them were dissatisfied with the way cameron was doing his job now thats almost doubled to presumably reflecting the changes to pensions which unfairly hit women these are electionchanging shifts they matter just as much as regional and class differences the chill in womens feelings for cameron wasnt just caused by the parliamentary exchanges or by cuts according to yougov polling the tories had a lead in female support until last christmas but had lost it by june well ahead of the calm down dear moment it must be particularly stinging for cameron because though it is hard to remember now he made such a play of being a new man and a prowomen politician when he was tory leadership candidate and then as opposition leader indeed his modernisation was really feminisation in he was championing the need for more women candidates and for the right reasons too which were not simply about fairness but about different ways of political thinking back then he said if you put eight conservative men round a table and ask them to discuss what should be done about pensions youd get some good answers but what you are less likely to get is a powerful insight into the massive unfairness relating to womens pensions we need people from diverse backgrounds to inform everything we do a new academic study by sarah childs and paul webb sex gender and the conservative party concludes that cameron backed away from his earlier determination to feminise the conservatives he did support alist candidates but after all the controversy the election returned a tory party in parliament of which only were women this say childs and webb was a major missed opportunity and owes much to camerons failure to lead on this they also remind us just how important the female vote is in the s the proconservative gap in vote choice between women and men was about of course in the thatcher years women voters were also a powerful protory factor it was only under new labour that the tories lost their hold on women there is a formidable message here those were the years when tories banged on endlessly and angrily about europe saving the pound and were riven by civil war leaving labour to talk about child tax credits early learning centres and better healthcare so why has cameron flinched why has this most touchyfeely of political leaders done so badly with women it cannot be all personal some of it is camerons apology this weekend saying he was not a sort of all right luv im down the pub tonight man hilariously missed the point nobody thought that about him nobody thinks he goes around in an old string vest sinking pints and smoking rollups either people think hes a posh boy with a default setting of condescension to women which he sometimes fails to hide quickly enough its rather different but yes there is more to it than that part of the story is that the austerity programme hits public services hard and early and these tend to be services women and children depend on most even this though does not explain his retreat inside the conservative party childs and webb hit that particular nail on the head after extensive focus group conversations they conclude that the party itself is largely uncomfortable with strong measures that will enhance womens election as parliamentary candidates even if it is supportive of the principle of womens greater descriptive representation this plays strongly to the idea that the tory party is influenced by two very different kinds of women the traditionalist members infamous for making sandwiches and stuffing envelopes and the career women that was true in the s and its even more so today the gap between people like louise mensch mp with her interviews about cosmetic surgery and her acknowledgement of drugtaking and the doughty matrons of traditional tory shire life is huge and of course the vast majority of women are neither they are struggling with kids and budgets neither rural cakebakers nor killerheeled thrusters while this has caused trouble for cameron it is much more serious for policymaking generally a coalition cabinet with more women round the table would have moved faster on the pensions problem and would surely have angled the cuts differently as well as taking different decisions on child tax credits and camerons misfortune is labours opportunity it was an interesting coincidence that the star of the labour conference was yvette cooper but its no coincidence that ed miliband is likely to promote several women such as rachel reeves emma reynolds and liz kendall in his forthcoming reshuffle so heres some advice for mr cameron which i dont expect him to take if you are really focused on winning the next election by yourself without the lib dems its time to promote more women read your old speeches and act on them as you used to know its about fairness but its also about

the magazine editor novelist and columnist rachel johnson is editor of the lady magazine and sister of the tory mayor of london boris johnson during the summer i bumped into a key downing st wonk at a sunday lunch in notting hill i told him his party had a woman problem not only were the tories failing to connect with women across the political spectrum i said although there was a brief babymoon when samantha produced florence the coalition was in danger of actively repelling the very women voters who had in previous years been loyal as labradors to the tory party for now tails dont wag whenever the prime minister a charming smoothie in the flesh tells a woman to calm down dear or suchlike since i took on a weekly magazine two years ago and became responsible for trying and failing to double circulation in a recession ive met an awful lot of middleaged tory women thousands probably and if i were dave and nick id be absolutely terrified for these women think that politicians in power come across as arrogant and overprivileged and out of touch with their concerns which are the nhs care for the elderly education and student fees they also worry about food price inflation the cost of childcare petrol and how theyre going to live on their pensions above all many many women ive met are in a state of controlled panic certainly not a quiet crisis about their families and in particular its younger members they wish that the coalition would stop trying to buy oldie votes with free bus passes and fuel allowances and so on weve had more than our share of lollipops in the boom part of the cycle and concentrate on the unders whose futures have already been mortgaged and beggared by my generation to pay for the bust i said some of the above to the wonk and wasnt surprised that my generous offer to help in his mission to make the coalition more relatable especially to my sex was quietly ignored the volunteer audrey pyle volunteer at age concern shop ive voted for the tories in the past mainly because i didnt like labour in the last election i voted for the conservatives in my local borough because they were better than labour in camden but i wouldnt vote for them again now not unless something major happened i can retire next year so for me its important that they sort out pensions at the moment retiring is a scary thought ill have to keep on working well who knows how long i dont think they look after the older person and theyd have to sort out their act on hospitals as well obviously im worried about hospital care i have experience of that with my neighbours and its not good so theyd have sort out their act on the nhs and pensions to make me vote for them again the trade unionist beverley woodburn s union organiser i dont support their policies particularly because of how they affect young people and as a black woman as well many people of my colour are in the national health service and in public service and i couldnt support their policies because of the devastating effect they have on the health services and on public services at the moment in their white paper theyre putting the whole education system out to tender basically to private business and private business has got no place in education weve just seen in the last year or so the student demonstrations regarding the hike in tuition fees and on this one we cant say its just the conservative government its being done with support with the coalition the fulltime mother elizabeth prentice fulltime mother i have voted conservative in the past this time i did because i thought they needed to sort out the economy which is a real mess at the moment and to make some hard decisions in principle im a conservative anyway and i support some of their ethical decisions i can still remember when labour came into power in the s when i was at university i was so excited they promised so much but it just seems like they screwed up and im not disillusioned with the conservatives yet at the moment i would still vote conservative in the next general election id find it really interesting to see what the conservatives would do without a coalition government with the reins of the lib dems taken off the communicator adah parris runs the school of communication arts wwwschoolcommunicationartscom why are there so few female creatives in advertising they account for a mere of an industry that contributes bn to the economy the future of that same economy relies upon people being involved in ideas innovation technology and having entrepreneurial acumen but to immerse yourself in any career takes sacrifice more so if youre woman especially if you have a family looking at the coalitions initiatives and policies youd be forgiven for thinking they are skewed towards men this year at the school we have students female and male the female ratio would have been higher but few mothers many of whom have the talent can bear the brunt of the financial loss further study involves especially with the cuts in childcare vouchers whats the incentive to go back to work or retrain if you are penalised for it the coalition talks about enabling social mobility and the creation of apprenticeship schemes but their recent leaked memo about womens fear for the next generation smells like a massive oh shit moment without much selfanalysis my humble advice look inwards before telling us to calm down dear the campaigner anne longfield obe is chief executive of the charity children and has worked in the field of child and family policy for over years most women didnt need the recent memo from no to tell them that the coalition isnt yet firing on all cylinders when it comes to policies for women either real or perceived the charge list is well documented the burden on women in budget cuts cuts to child benefit so soon in the administration and with such seeming ease reductions in support for childcare through tax credits whichever way you look at it they all give the impression of a government that isnt giving much thought to women now of course women know that times are tough and understand the need for a strong economy but women also know the way this will be achieved will be by building strong communities and families that are confident and able to fulfil their and their countrys ambitions and there are some green coalition shoots that could start to deliver some of this commitments to become familyfriendly with a promised new family test across government investment in the early years support for parenting and flexible working yet they remain in their infancy and when they are announced its done so quietly almost a little apologetically so here is the challenge if the coalition does want to make a difference put

jane robinsons centenary history of the womens institute sets out to show that the organisation is not all about jam and jerusalem instead robinsons wi is a feminist force to be reckoned with not bloodandthunder feminism admittedly but a more downtoearth brand to do with selfrespect and just reward the problem with this argument is that wi women have always made jam during the second world war five jambusters produced jars between them in a single season and theyve always sung jerusalem in a key almost beyond human hearing said joyce grenfell attending a wi meeting in they sang it demurely in the early days patriotically during the second world war even when in one village the home guard had chopped the legs off the piano and the pianist had to lie on the floor and rebelliously in more recent times a few years ago a group of wi demonstrators in gloucestershire roused hundreds of marchers into singing jerusalem at a protest against hospital closures yes theyve had their radical moments along the way famously they slowclapped tony blair off the stage during his speech at their agm in one year after a group of courageous middleaged yorkshire women had bared all for the calendar celebrated in calendar girls though perhaps they didnt quite conquer the world as robinson suggests wi women have always campaigned for radical unladylike issues in they were vociferous in demanding better education about sexually transmitted diseases after huge numbers of soldiers returning from the first world war infected their wives the organisation has had its share of impressive leaders the most redoubtable was lady gertrude denman who was in charge before and during the second world war she was the archetypal feisty english eccentric driving her pony through her country estate using a frying pan for a whip axing down trees along the way and she got things done as the wife of the governor of australia she managed to introduce healthcare to the australian bush when she wasnt busy playing hockey in her ballroom as the head of the wi she tirelessly promoted education and social reform but even denmans tone could be saccharine when it came to the wi i think that country women are the salt of the earth she announced in and although she herself was refreshingly free from classconsciousness many individual wis remained inwardlooking and parochial under her leadership in the s wis throughout britain adopted families of the unemployed in a spirit as patronising as it was helpful during the war several wi branches protested about having to take in refugees from the city complaining that they would be diseased and dishonest thanks to robinsons wideranging research and stylish writing a force to be reckoned with is a spirited and engaging read but its a book for the already converted although not a wi member herself robinson is happily seduced by its rhetoric the wi made friends of strangers confident speakers of the shy and skilled craftswomen of haphazard amateurs she writes yes but did that actually make it a force to be reckoned with it was hard to be too gloomy if you were enjoying a game of blindfold pin the moustache on hitler or sitting with your closest friends in the blackout knitting army socks for other mothers sons she remarks with more enthusiasm than irony when describing the wartime activities of the wi ultimately the wi emerges as an organisation of selfsatisfied rural women doing good and having fun along the way they remain wholesome even when theyre posing nude or pole dancing the wi clearly still does much to promote friendship in a society preoccupied with ambition competition and sex in this sense its providing a useful service thankfully however its possible to be a dirty unfriendly towndweller and

in the last general election electors decided who to vote for as much on the appeal of the leader of each party or lack of it as the policies among women in particular david cameron did well he continues to do better than nick clegg or ed miliband however the impact of some of the coalitions policies are beginning to turn women away particularly cs skilled manual workers who are key in swing seats if this trend continues the coalition has reason to be anxious the resolution foundation thinktank asked ipsos mori to analyse voting intentions of women the findings published last week reveal that after the general election in one poll of women supported the conservatives however female approval for the coalition has now plummeted to in addition just of females feel the conservatives are the party that are closest to women and best understand their views and just have the same sentiments about the lib dems while the tories gained some support among female abs c women are rapidly moving back to labour a tide that could easily turn an election labour enjoys support among the cs a rise of from last years election the leak in september of a restricted document on how to get more support from women written by officials in no and circulated to government departments is hardly reassuring for the coalition under a section entitled the problem the document says we are clear that there are a range of policies we have pursued as a government which are seen as having hit women or their interests disproportionately the document includes suggestions on shorter summer holidays for children a good idea but possibly showing a lack of awareness that only of households have children a ban on advertising to children and a vague promise to set up a review on the barriers on women entering politics what is omitted from the list indicates the scale of the coalitions inability to come up with measures that might woo their lost vote back what c women say they need are jobs a decent income support with childcare the government contribution of for those on tax credits has been cut to and a welfare system that knits together effectively so that work rather than a life on benefits pays more as a result of the coalitions policies childcare costs have increased and as threequarters of jobs in the public sector are held by women they have also been hit hardest by the cuts add to that changes to pensions a proposal to meanstest child benefit now rapidly going through a rethink the increase in tuition fees and if the welfare reform bill becomes law caps to housing benefits and childrens disability benefits among others the creation of a single universal credit is also fraught with problems for a mother on a low income if the governments it record is any guide last but not least of course there is the patronising tone towards women that cameron seems intent on perfecting week by week he told labour mp angela eagle to calm down dear and he referred to his

the nations first professor of mens health alan white of leeds metropolitan university has announced that sheds are the answer to mens ailments apparently pottering around doing odd jobs is therapeutic theres a sense of achievement that men get from starting a task and seeing it through to completion its good for selfesteem unlike women of course who thrive on going at things halfarsedly and looking around with satisfaction at the end of a day at all the things they didnt manage to finish but perhaps well come back to that you know if i can be bothered whites discovery is being adduced as evidence in support of the mens sheds charitable scheme to bring communal sheds to the shedless where they can meet potter maybe pootle why not and be gently encouraged to visit the doctor when they get a twinge or headache instead of hoping that mending the lawnmower will do obviously im not sure what form this encouragement takes as my gender forbids my entry to these hallowed sanctums maybe some cheerful posters maybe an undercover health official or maybe a communal shed is like the secret sevens gang hut but with prostate exams instead of a password who knows the mens shed movement began in australia about four years ago and there are now sheds under its aegis in the uk i wondered then and i wonder now why it was decreed that men needed sheds more than women which sex has historically had the power to barricade itself in its studyclubrecently conquered country and relax with a glass of port conversely whose lives have traditionally been dominated by serving the needs of others whose concentration is most often broken by calls on her oh im sorry have i given the game away time from children or cohabitees who still dont know where the clean towels are kept and miscellaneous idiots at work who believe that it is the nearest womans job to clear up the literal and metaphorical messes they leave behind yes women need sheds far more than men wheres our charitable funding im writing this in a freezing loft conversion and can hear husband and baby coming up the stairs to get me though at least only one of them is crying at the moment what i wouldnt give for a dozen metres of muddy turf and a tangle of thorny thicket to deter them maybe ill just institute a mandatory prostate exam instead yes that ought to do it,2011-11,nation first professor men

ladies how are your marriage prospects looking good bad in need of an ironing perhaps if you alphabetise them they will look more enticing attractive bed in possession of incredible skills in cute doesnt earn more than any prospective suitor excellent at phone sex fiercely desirous of marrying a man whose money will give you access to business class lounges for the rest of your days etc aw your marriage prospects look adorable arranged like that you should get them covered in cath kidston fabric to make them as pretty as possible or perhaps you have not considered your marriage prospects at all perhaps you have thought that the term marriage prospects sounds about as anachronistic and austenian as in waist maybe you didnt even think that marriageability was a quality let alone a quantifiable one beyond perhaps brushes teeth occasionally has a bath all else subjective yet in the much discussed article in us magazine the atlantic by kate bolick republished last weekend in the observer and already in inevitable talks of a tv spinoff she describes why she and an intriguingly homogenous yet amorphous sounding group of women like her will never marry due to various marriageability issues so lets discuss marriageability i am at an advantage here being based in new york city marriage and ones marriageability tend to be presented here with a strange combination of pragmatic formality combined with hysterical fetishisation that bolick perhaps inadvertently captured in her piece there are many things one can say about how feminism has affected womens attitudes to marriage but one theory of bolicks exemplified a certain attitude that makes so many depictions of marriage in the media here feel so retrograde american women as a whole have never been confronted with such a radically shrinking pool of what are traditionally considered to be marriageable men those who are better educated and earn more than they do so women are now contending with what we might call the new scarcity yes we might call it that if one could only countenance consorting with men who earn more than oneself this weirdly monetised and loveless view of marriage in america will not surprise anyone who has gawped at the vows section in the new york times sunday edition photos of grinning couples sit atop detailed descriptions of not just their jobs and social standing mr jaeger

entry from this weekend but those of their parents his mother is a member of the board of trustees at the jewish museum of new york another entry assures readers to read this section is like reading a satirical chapter of an edith wharton novel without a punch line yet it is an established part of the paper probably best known here for its appearance in an episode of sex in the city in which one of the characters frantically tries to be featured in it clearly vows is no more representative of new york let alone america as a whole than bridget joness daily life was of britain but it does reflect an attitude that plays into the fascination the american media has in single women such is the popularity of investigations into the enthralling mystery of single women that these articles are pretty much their own genre of journalism in america characterised by gloomy warnings about the dangers of feminism cod anthropological claims regrets about leaving a nice man because the writer wanted an unspecified more selfflagellation dressed up as honesty about feminism and they are always always written by a woman bolicks piece is a perfect example of this as was lori gottliebs similarly hoohahed article marry him also published in the atlantic the reason they attract so much attention is because the media love any stories that suggest independent women will be punished and because many women readers in my experience glob on to articles that voice their worst fears with meta irony such an article was featured in sex and the city just as that show itself became another example of selfflagellation with a feminist fig leaf when carrie was featured in a piece titled single and fabulous emphasis on the question mark one sees this less in britain beyond the pages of the daily mail of course which last week featured an article with the unimprovably hilarious headline too sexy too laid back too independent why some women just arent wife material its amazing the daily mail didnt selfcombust after publishing that piece i would have thought that a far more damaging factor than a womans career to her marriageability would be the broken nose caused by her head clunking down on the kitchen table when faced with another article about the foolhardiness of single women today yet perhaps that is missing the point perhaps these articles from the atlantic to the daily mail are all part of a plot to make single women feel better for having failed to keep a man while hanging out in a singlesex dutch commune as bolick nigh on parodically does at the end of her piece might not be the happily ever after you dreamed of it sure sounds better than being with the vision of humanity these articles present this kind of talk reduces men to insecure throwbacks with machismo and ego issues and women to conniving venal fools if those are the options no wonder so many people arent attending to their marriage prospects and would prefer to be alone,2011-11,lady marriage prospect

divorce is the likely fate for almost half of all marriages which if you can bear to be entirely coldblooded about a hugely traumatic emotional event makes it extraordinary that some people still manage to be so bad at it and even more extraordinary that the bitterness of divorcees should be celebrated this week the telegraph ran an interview with robin williams whos on some sort of a promo junket for a new zelda game skyward sword which was headlined with one of the actors old gags about the emasculating effects of alimony ah yes divorce from the latin word meaning to rip out a mans genitals through his wallet presumably this was met with much highfiving at nintendo pr hq weve got a page it doesnt mention the game much but theres a castration angle which we think is very onbrand its journalistically perverse to lead on a dredgedup line but its even more perverse to think that there was a time in williamss career when it seemed like a smart or civil thing to wring comic material out of the dissolution of two relationships by likening paying maintenance to the mothers of his children to being violently desexed even when the emotion seems justifiable ostentatious displays of resentment are a grim thing to behold john cleeses divorce settlement has been publicised as costing him up to m definitely enough to sting a bit yet when he launched the alimony tour claiming hed been forced out of retirement to service the financial demands of his exwife it all felt a bit unpleasant there are plenty of personally aggrieved middleaged people gladly laughing along as cleese calculates the daily cost of his marriage but if you find yourself looking on years of marriage as nothing but a painful money pit maybe youve been doing something wrong for a while everyone who says the till death bit surely does it in good faith but when of unions bite it before either of their participants according to the office for national statistics its a colossal act of delusion to imagine that youre going to be on the lucky side of the coin toss and then be furious when things turn out otherwise it is possible to divorce without taking away spite and bile with your part of the shared assets if both parties are willing to cooperate paula hall relationship psychotherapist with relate and author of how to have a healthy divorce suggests choosing solicitors who practice amicable law a marriage that ends in divorce doesnt suddenly become a marriage thats been bad for its duration people change and relationships change and sometimes its just not possible for a couple to ensure theyre changing in the same direction says hall when that happens its probably better however painful it might be to shake hands move on and be happy individuals divorcing doesnt mean youve

it is not often in these dark times that one stumbles across a snippet of good economic news so its strange that one such shaft of sunlight in the gloom has gone mostly unsung according to official statistics released last week the pay gap between men and women that barometer of shifting power between the sexes has quietly shrunk to a record low and among younger women has shot clearly into reverse women in their s now earn a solid more on average than men their age after narrowly overtaking them for the first time last year the rise of the female breadwinner it seems was no blip but the beginning perhaps of a social and sexual sea change for an angry but vocal minority that is a change too far yet more proof that they are the underdogs now trampled beneath the stilettoes of supposedly overmighty women the conservative family policy expert jill kirby even suggested that the pay gap we should be worrying about is the one that shows young men falling behind not the one that still sees men earning more than women for every other decade of their working life losing ground is admittedly never easy even if that ground wasnt always earned as one glance at the tory backbenches boiling with resentment at young women being promoted over older male heads confirms the trouble with shattering the glass ceiling is that someone inevitably ends up ducking the flying fragments but its worth remembering that barely a century ago the great male fear was not of alpha females with intimidatingly large salaries but their polar opposite women were seen rather like immigrant labour now as dangerously liable to undercut mens wages by doing the same work for less equal pay was sold not as a threat but rather intriguingly as a promise as the then mayor of new york put it in explaining his decision to grant female teachers the same salaries as men instead of lessening the number of male teachers this will increase it by removing the financial incentive to hire women even in the royal commission on equal pay set up in britain argued that equality would mean women losing their jobs since at equal pay for men and women a man will always be preferred why on earth would you hire a woman unless she was going cheap half a century on it seems incredibly meanspirited not to allow young women at least a moments triumph over proving such arguments wrong before making them hang their heads in shame for the men they have left behind but instead the same reproachful message has been drummed into them since their teens when they outstripped boys at gcse and alevel only to face howls of protest about education being rigged in their favour its not that this argument was without any merit where boys are failing schools should question whats happening in the classroom its just depressing that the debate so often contrived to make young girls strengths greater social confidence and maturity or a conscientiousness that makes them better at coursework sound strangely like cheating since these skills have turned out to be undeniably handy after all those same girls went on to beat boys at degree level to form the majority of trainee barristers and solicitors and fasttrack civil servants by the middle of the last decade theyre the same girls who a graduate recruiter once told me shone so much at interview that they left the boys standing and they grew up into the same junior managers who according to a recent survey for the chartered management institute now outearn their male counterparts for the first time since even if the pay gap between senior executives still yawns so wide that the cmi estimates it will take a century to close they must have been doing something right what is emerging now is a striking generational divide the pay gap for fulltime workers is biggest now for women in their s those least likely to have been encouraged when young to pursue a career or hang on to one after children but it narrows with every decade subtracted from a womans age roughly speaking as girls horizons have widened and their skill sets swelled only a quarter of girls went to university in the s for example whereas by they outnumbered boys their earning power has risen in tandem legislation industrial action a greater emphasis on traditionally female skills such as communication and sheer bloodymindedness all helped but one reason young women now get paid more than their mothers is simply that theyre worth it a basic fairness that matters more to a cohesive society than perhaps we used to think after all what fuels the festering anger at rocketing boardroom pay isnt just naked envy of the increase in some top bosses salaries over the past three decades as the high pay commission reported but a feeling that theres no rhyme nor reason to it its not as if their companies are thousands of times more profitable and this breaking of the link between effort and reward is a profoundly unsettling thing why strive to do your best if you get nothing while the undeserving merrily trouser their bonuses which is precisely how too many women have long felt about their male colleagues its easy to forget not just how stonkingly grievously unfair things have been in the past but also how tentative these female gains have been men who work full time still earn more than women overall hardly suggestive of being

from the age of precisely when mrs average now has her first child its far from clear that this generation of golden girls can beat the socalled motherhood penalty either by managing hitherto

as she approaches kate bolick has come to a profound insight that she and many american women like her might never marry but revealing that fact in the atlantic magazine caused an outbreak of soulsearching and frenzied comment here she talks to lisa okelly your piece went viral as soon as it was published in the atlantic magazine in the us in october sparking a slew of reaction pieces in online magazines such as slate and the huffington post not to mention likes on facebook were you surprised at the scale of the response i was really surprised i had no idea the piece would attract that kind of attention its the second most popular story of the year for the atlantic and ive been asked to do a ton of radio and television each phonein programme ive done the lines have been flooded there have been countless articles about the article i havent even read all of them its a really surreal experience being written about in this way the reaction has been across the board from positive to negative im still getting hundreds of emails from men and women of all ages all over the world and those run the gamut predominantly though im hearing from single people who are feeling happy and relieved to hear about this growing demographic and to read someone who is speaking to their experience ive also had love letters and quite a few marriage proposals that has been really funny why do you think there has been such a tremendous response to the piece ive been trying to figure it out and i think the main reason is that we are in a very conservative moment socially this is surprising since there has been so much progress on samesex marriage which makes it seem as though we are at a progressive moment for gender relations but in the heterosexual world were in a very conservative place the fact that a single heterosexual woman simply questioning the primacy of marriage should create such a storm is proof enough of that apparently you have annoyed some male readers yes i think a lot of men are feeling vulnerable and scared at the moment because their economic power and influence is dwindling and i dont think i was sensitive enough to that when i was writing the article i was coming at it from a female standpoint because that was what i was asked to do and that was how i felt most comfortable writing but id like to see a male equivalent of my article now have any of your exes commented on the article yes but only in a positive way they are all very excited by the reaction do you consider yourself a feminist i do yes what does that mean in in essence the oldschool feminist principles such as equal pay equal rights a womans right to be in control of her own body and her own life these things still hold true today for everyone but because of the way the arguments are sometimes framed there is a lot of misperception of what feminism is now people say theyre not feminists but then if you ask them if they agree with equal pay theyll say yes i wanted to discuss these ideas in a way that was open and accessible a lot of feminist discourse can be alienating because it is more polemic there are now plans to turn the piece into a tv series i am beyond excited about it i was approached by josh berman creator of drop dead diva a hit us drama series about a pretty twentysomething actress who dies and is reincarnated as an older frumpy lawyer who loved the ideas in the article and convinced his executives at sony that he could turn it into a scripted series not a reality show i dont know josh but ive seen an episode of drop dead diva and i really liked the way it dealt with womens body issues in a comic but intelligent way im going to be a coproducer and creative consultant once it gets off the ground who will play you i have no idea but its quite fun to think about who would be my ideal choice to play the yearold me who would be the yearold me and so on i cant decide,2011-11,approach kate bolick ha come profound insight many american woman

when the tory mp for corby louise bagshawe became louise mensch following her second marriage to a us rock manager there appeared to be obvious career disadvantages to a name change she described as an act of love in branding terms the transformation was arguably the most daring act of love since her majestys post office renamed itself consignia and mensch to judge by the response from spectator bloggers was a name even less perfectly designed to please english traditionalists with a predisposition for conventeducated blondes from trollope country a further advantage when she was adopted as an alist tory candidate had been menschs already towering reputation in chicklit circles as the bestselling novelist louise bagshawe was it wise for a novice mp so decisively to discard this builtin advantage oh ye of little faith only people who are likely to read a novel called sparkles had heard of louise bagshawe everyone has heard of louise mensch how was this achieved in less than six months it would probably be too simple for the post office and others seeking similar transformation to conclude that all that was required to complete her separation into two distinct entities amoebastyle was for mensch to ensure that her new brand was never out of the public eye for longer than seconds true her use of twitter sometimes makes stephen frys look painfully reticent at the time of writing bulletins have emerged from the busy selfstyled single mothers base in corby within two hours from the parochial everybody local should follow oundleonline to the pointed if completely pointless ed miliband worst leader party has ever had and i seen a few menschs command of the independent media has also been exemplary in particular her superb response to attempted muckraking about bagshawes youthful misbehaviour and drug use although i do not remember the specific incident this sounds highly probable disarmed many tabloidhating bien pensants who might otherwise have struggled with her smarmier devotions to david cameron this bewildering sympatheticghastly pattern of utterances has characterised menschs speedy progression from womens interest mp to her currently unassailable position as britains least loathsome tory for instance memories of menschs early interrogation of james murdoch mr camerons friend would compensate subsequently for a witless sally on have i got news for you in which she arraigned occupy protesters for patronising starbucks her sowhat attitudes to plastic surgery and class a drugs helped deflect the derision that might otherwise have followed a less modern proposal that social media be temporarily shut down to control the riots it would be perverse not to mention that far more groomed than bagshawe mensch has advertised the wifely importance of husbandpleasing in pretty clothes at the same time nb feminists as she inhabits a different continent from mr mensch even her namechanging as an act of love is not it has been noted a tribute she applied to her first husband or she would have entered parliament as louise locicero but in one key area which is now making her name mensch is on her way to being a model of consistency she is a mother and having children as she said on radio explaining her request that employers take in children during the strikes is an absolute social good it follows mensch says that people that dont have children really need to make accommodation for example it might be that a mother has carelessly arranged to interrogate james murdoch at some public hearing at the same time that she would like to pick the social goods up from school far from being astonished by this affront to parents who find they have to plan for this regular interruption of the working day colleagues should emulate the understanding we witnessed from mr murdoch when ms mensch calmly announced that she had more important things to do than listen to his answers it was as if a giant x containing one blonde mother three children and in case of doubt a pink sign reading little princess on board had just rolled over the committee room en route to ballet as a single mother its a job i try not to delegate mensch tweeted later a sentence some single mothers might do well to memorise before camerons attack on the somethingfornothing generation begins in earnest now in a coalition that has struggled to establish that cameron meant no more by calm down dear than did steve hilton on the abolition of maternity rights corbys answer to mother courage evidently doubles as its solution to the female problem being a kind of oneperson mumsnet last week mensch was stressing the inconvenience to hardpressed mothers in particular of people disruptively going on strike over pensions there being a presumption that no striker inconsiderate enough to disoblige someone like louise mensch might herself be a mother or even a father and what of all the nonparents striking or not just a few weeks ago barnardos announced that when polled almost half its respondents described modern children as incipiently feral is it likely they are looking forward to menschs take your kids to work day in a louise bagshawe novel desire for example this might be the cue for one of her signature oneline paragraphs how stupid what a mistake as a fellow parent i have noticed that mensch is not alone in the delusion that by reproducing she has done society a massive favour rather than indulge an entirely selfish scheme for personal fulfilment these altruistic apologias are regularly heard from parents who devote their waking lives to ensuring that their children will not be among those doomed when we run out of migrants to do anything so useful as wipe centenarians bottoms admittedly these are early days if dna counts for anything the little menschs may grow up to write books such as sparkles and glitz prior to becoming valued tory mps however given a growing anxiety about overpopulation that is not confined to david attenborough even an unlimited supply of chicklit flowing through generations might look like a mixed blessing still the tories are right in one thing mensch is definitely female assuming that most normal females believe along with the partys celebrity mothers in reproduction as their purpose in life arent they bound to be thrilled with their new its a job i

during the summer the prime ministers advisers crunched numbers that showed the conservatives had a problem with female voters and by september a document detailing policies that might build bridges had been drawn up that strategy document did not offer a silver bullet or indeed a big bazooka but lots of more modest pieces of ammunition that together it was thought would gradually repair david camerons image for a tangle of reasons women are often public sector workers and so affected by cuts they use public services and so ditto there has been a dramatic drop in the coalitions standing with c women since taking office the last guardianicm poll appeared to bear out the conservative panic and suggests they still have work to do although the results for particular groups are less definitive than those for the whole population the detailed data this month suggested that just of women intend to vote conservative compared with of men and this was no rogue result the gender gap in october was even bigger the government has been working on several fronts to boost its standing with women the changes in tone came quickly in his party conference speech cameron announced that he wanted a consultation on allowing gay marriage not just civil partnerships before the end of the next parliament an emphasis on marriage his pollsters believe appeals to female voters the next day iain duncan smith the work and pensions secretary and nick clegg announced money and work to ameliorate a change that would otherwise have meant further cuts to childcare the efficacy of this move has since been doubted by expert analysts and indeed nontory pollsters doubt whether women are particularly exercised by childcare but as far as the coalition is concerned it showed willing the strategy memo leaked to the guardian also proposed a debate on a reduction in the long summer holiday to help working families if were feeling brave it said this is tricky in the context of more school autonomy but we could try some exhortation it also proposed frontloading child benefit to help parents struggling with childcare and lost earnings in their childrens first years there has been no movement on these fronts but other proposals have seen more activity there has been a move towards a proper ban on advertising to children also in the days after the party conference there was a first step by the prime minister towards criminalising forced marriage with a consultation launched because as the strategy document revealed the coalition thought signals sent out by opting not to criminalise is a bad one another proposal a no summit for women in business has also come about on policies already under way but for which the strategy suggested more publicity such as plans for flexible working and parental leave there has been questionable progress in highlighting any good work they are doing because of the fuss over whether ideas contained in the beecroft report on employment laws included an end to maternity leave for small companies something which while vetoed by the prime minister will have done a great deal of harm the emphasis recently on the housing market and help for young people including a push to help reduce youth unemployment is also in part related to the womens strategy the thinking being that women feel more guilt about the generational squeeze but there are also ideas that have not yet seen the light of day including personal budgets for maternity services to allow women to shop around for services developing a strategy including possible crossparty work to ensure there are more female candidates for mayoral posts elected police commissioners and local enterprise partnerships changing plans for the new universal credit to give it to women automatically instead of allowing the applicant to nominate a household member and setting up a website to allow women to anonymously disclose and compare their salaries with others in their industry cameron is also appointing a senior female adviser from outside the civil service to assess the impact of every coalition policy on women in the runup to the party conference cameron gave an interview to the sunday times in which he even apologised for two incidents when in the commons chamber he told a female mp to calm down dear a phrase that may now live longer than michael winner could ever have hoped and when in the same place he told one of his own mps nadine dorries who was struggling to be heard that she might be frustrated the prime minister followed this by opening the doors of downing street to grazia magazine he and his wife revealed their new zinc kitchen and shared stories such as one about how difficult it is to go out for a romantic date when you are so famous the first time sam and i went out for a romantic dinner after id become pm she leaned across to me and whispered im sure i recognise that guy at the next door table and i said yes darling theyre the protection team tackling the calm down dear moment headon he put the two commons chamber gaffes down to the gladiatorial nature of prime ministers questions a ritual he revealed he did not like it was he said an unpleasantlooking thing that i have to do every week it is confrontational adversarial and quite difficult to be anything else unless you want to get completely squashed by the other side i think that sometimes you can come across in a way that you dont mean to thats not the real you you come across as a macho aggressive male and i think thats what pmqs tends to push you in to in the end he defended himself samantha does think think that all this is not an accurate representation of who i am but because his wife had vowed not to give interviews cameron said

when i was editor of the erotic review there was a distinct difference between the genders when i was beseeching authors to write something sexy for the magazine if women acquiesced they would generally apply themselves to the task with determination and sincerity mining their own experience and desires in pursuit of genuinely erotic prose men on the other hand often trembled at the thought of applying themselves with that degree of naked sincerity one well known author and broadcaster was fairly representative when he told me i can write about sex but only if its bad comedic absurd embarrassing or downright disgusting i cant begin to write about making love because the very thought makes my toes curl he protested that anglosaxon men just dont feel comfortable with that degree of exposure which is exactly why the late auberon waugh instigated the literary review bad sex in literature awards to punish those who dont show such reticence perhaps this helps explain why year after year the number of male nominations for the bad sex awards far outstrips those by female authors this years list is no exception there are only two women on the provisional long list of jean auel and dori ostermiller while there are plenty of wellknown male offenders such as stephen king lee child sebastian barry and david guterson i read gutersons book ed king and i have to say the sex scenes and every part of the book come to that were so mortifyingly awful that i wiped them from my memory and chucked the volume in the bin just as i thought my mind and soul were purged here comes the literary review to remind me of the horror in the shower ed stood with his hands at the back of his head like someone just arrested while she abused him with a bar of soap all i can say is that this is the lightest and most tasteful of the excerpts i can only posit a theory but i tend to blame the higher rate of mortifying sex scenes in novels by men on the nature of their fantasies during my years at the coalface of eroticism i noted that the chaps are more likely to grow hot under the colour about a particular sexual scenario shall we say a woman in high heels walking over him in a short skirt without panties whereas women are interested in the detail surrounding the story they cant turn it into a satisfactory fantasy unless they have striven to make it realistic who is this woman what is her backstory and motivation and what brand are the heels thus when women write sex scenes they often sound truer and less ridiculous not always of course but too many men offer us the fantasies of grownup schoolboys i refer you to the following passage from the humbling by philip roth which won him a lifetime achievements award from the literary review it was english that pegeen spoke when she looked over from where she was now resting on her back beside tracy combing the little black catoninetails through tracys long hair and with that kidlike smile that showed her two front teeth said to him softly your turn defile her she took tracy by one shoulder whispered time to change masters and gently rolled the strangers large warm body toward his three children got together he said and decided to put on a play whereupon his performance began this passage reminds me of the many battles i had when editing the late simon raven who seemed unable to conceive of a short story that didnt end with a young boy in cricket whites having sex with his mother his aunt or even his grandmother raven was famously a thoroughly bad boy even in his eighth decade and his imagination never strayed far from something nasty in the nursery conversely it is simply impossible to imagine as byatt or hilary mantel troubling their readers with a clich straight from a ropey old porn film they are simply too dignified meanwhile those women authors who do apply themselves to the hard task of writing about sex tend to do so with veracity and a distinctly grownup sensibility i never feel ive stumbled across the crazed fantasies of an upper fifthformer when im reading the novels of julie myerson michelle roberts rose tremain or tessa hadley all of whom tackle eroticism head on it is my solemn duty to note as i end that all generalisations are there to be vigorously undermined sebastian faulks wrote one of the most successfully kinetic sex scenes in literature in birdsong it always seemed to me that the books huge success had as much to do with the flushed cheeks of housewives across the nation as it did to the authors diligent research on sappers and as for my personal prize for the worst sex writing in english literature i award it to one rosa mundi a pseudonym for a renowned female novelist for the following passages in the novel vocational girl mundi writes of a blowjob i like the feeling of my lips being stretched the incorporation of the chthonic male other into the mouth from which i speak the head from which i think the face which is my polite persona in the nonsexual

today is the international day for the elimination of violence against women the phrase violence against women calls for comment it names the victims but not the perpetrators the fact that men are mainly responsible for violent and healthharming behaviours not only against women and children but also against each other is so taken for granted that it slips beneath the radar of commentators and policymakers take the riots of august this year as the suspects were charged considerable detail was published by the ministry of justice the press focused on the age ethnicity neighbourhood and employment status of offenders yet by far the most dramatic divergence the statistics revealed was gender of the first defendants were male something yet more significant went unremarked of the individuals charged with offences involving violence all were male when information on a further people charged with rioting offences was issued by the moj a month later the focus was on the fact that of the defendants had a previous caution or conviction few noted that the moj had chosen to focus only on male rioters females were absent from these average recidivists what we saw was a palpable concern with the youth class and race of rioters but a lack of analysis of the key fact the statistics illustrate the culpability and cost of masculinity as so often masculine antisocial behaviour was just the wallpaper in the social scientist and policy activist barbara wootton looked at the crime statistics and remarked that if men behaved like women the courts would be idle and the prisons empty half a century later the british crime survey and police crime figures bear her out in men were perpetrators in of all violent incidents in england and wales the figures vary by type of incident for domestic violence for assault for wounding for mugging for robbery moj figures for show men to be responsible for and of sexual offences drug offences and criminal damage respectively of child sex offenders are male the highest percentages of female offences concern fraud and forgery and theft and handling stolen goods female the moj publishes an annual report women and the criminal justice system whose purpose is to fulfil the equality provision in the criminal justice act but looking at statistics on women conceals the obvious a comparable report on men and the criminal justice system would be policy dynamite on the road men commit of all traffic offences and of speeding offences more people are killed and injured in road accidents than anywhere else and home office data reveal the bearing of masculinity here too men are responsible for of dangerous driving offences and of motoring offences causing death or bodily harm a world health organisation report in on gender and road traffic injuries cautiously broke the code of silence by remarking that masculinity may be hazardous to health some of the costs of masculinity are paid individually boys are permanently excluded from school at a rate four times higher than for girls and attain fewer gcse and alevels than girls but what of the overall costs to society take prison costs alone an estimated per prisoner a year of whom are male if men committed crimes leading to custodial sentences at the rate women do the exchequer would save about bn a year zoom out to the overall cost of crime calculated by the home office at bn a year in including not only criminal justice system costs but lost productivity service costs and impact on victims if men committed as few crimes as women the overall number of incidents would fall by this creates an annual saving of bn equivalent to almost a third of last years public sector budget deficit however the most masculine crimes are the most expensive a homicide a sexual offence and a serious wounding cost m and respectively figures the most feminine crime theft is the cheapest at per incident thus the real saving to the uk of such a change in male behaviour would be vastly greater as the british medical journal recently pointed out this lifedamaging gender difference must be challenged by addressing the culture of masculinity that sustains them how men and women behave is socially shaped popular understandings of masculine characteristics play up biology testosterone the male hormone the metaphor of manhood is portrayed as driving men inexorably towards aggressive behaviour yet studies show that testosterone is related to statusseeking but not directly to aggression many other factors are influential testosterone levels are increased or diminished in both males and females by diet activity and circumstance the opportunity to interact with guns for instance appears to increase testosterone while mens testosterone levels fall when they are involved with the care of children the case we are making is that certain widespread masculine traits and behaviours are dangerous and costly both to individuals and society they are amenable to purposeful change the culture of masculinity can be and should be addressed as a policy issue this article was amended on december the original said an annual saving of bn a year would wipe out the current public sector

on international day for the elimination of violence against women we call on the justice secretary to protect women and children from violence by protecting their access to legal aid legal aid cuts will hurt the most vulnerable says report november the uk government has taken great strides in tackling violence against women in recent years in march the government published a crossgovernment strategy call to end violence against women and girls which sets out a number of proposals designed to take action to reduce the risk to women and girls who are victims of these crimes and to ensure perpetrators are brought to justice this recent progress makes the legal aid reforms currently being debated in parliament all the more disappointing the proposals fail to acknowledge that legal aid is a vital lifesaving resource for women who have experienced violence and risk undermining wider government commitments to improve womens access to justice this is not an ideological issue it is one of basic fairness and justice if these principles are not upheld we risk undermining the foundations of civil society and it is vulnerable women and children who will ultimately pay the price ruth

chief executive refuge marai larasi director imkaan emma scott director rights of women among the most grievous of the governments legal aid plans are the thoughtless restrictions on aid for victims of domestic violence this will seriously restrict access to the family courts where single parents who have been victims of partner violence need legal aid to be able to protect themselves and their children as patricia scotland pointed out in the lords debate on monday the definition of domestic violence used to judge eligibility for legal aid will be much narrower than what we normally understand by abuse the burden of evidence that victims have to bear will become prohibitive a doctors testimony of injuries will not be sufficient for example neither will a police report or even an arrest should victims get as far as court the end of legal aid for alleged perpetrators will mean victims being crossexamined by their abusers the potential savings from denying legal aid to victims of domestic violence will be small but the effect on those victims will be devastating we urge the government to reconsider fiona weir chief executive gingerbread,2011-11,international day elimination

it was election night and david dimbleby had a cabinet minister on the line now he said momentarily flustered here is ed balls wife its hard to imagine the bbcs national treasure doing that today after months in opposition yvette cooper is on a roll and her name is the one on political lips cooper first as equalities minister and now shadow home secretary has led the charge against the cameron administration and its impact on the lives of women first by focusing on the uneven distribution of economic hardship and as of today by highlighting the threat as she sees it to womens safety not only has she made direct hits on an administration losing support among women but she has done it while avoiding the sort of snitty headlines and rolled eyeballs just think harriet harperson that womens issues usually attract how a steady focus on the numbers and a demeanour so serious it can verge on the gimleteyed has helped she also combines a refusal to do touchyfeely with a sharp eye for a populist policy support for bobbies on the beat for example that has proved a winning combination in westminster and among the rightwing press she is said one tryingnottobenasty piece recently the only way her husband will get to downing street in an interview to launch her campaign on what she calls a government blind spot cooper is exactly as you would expect apart from her slightly incongruous small pink phone she smiles a lot yet is never exactly warm especially when repeating her line about not wanting to be leader of the labour party she also shows the grasp of detail and ability to talk about the lives of ordinary women that has made her one of labours most feared frontbenchers weve done a lot of work around the economics and now were concerned about increasing evidence that the government is becoming similarly careless on womens safety she says the fact that there has been a series of legislative changes that has started to impact on womens safety is worrying its a blind spot among coalition policies causing concern are changes that will make it harder for victims of domestic abuse to claim legal aid the scale and pace of cuts in police budgets and funding cuts that show half of local authorities are to reduce street lighting on the back of these preliminary findings labour has appointed lawyer and activist vera baird to gather evidence of increased violence and risk there is evidence historically that times of economic pressure and high unemployment lead to an increase in domestic violence i think it will grow predicts cooper what you want to do is prevent it with something like street lighting its not just about the data but about whether people feel safe specifically whether women feel they can get the bus back home she says this focus on feelings of security rather than hard evidence of increased assault will be criticised by her political opponents but campaigners have welcomed the support zohra moosa womens rights adviser of actionaid uk says the recognition that violence is more than just physical assault is really important cooper has also made four concrete proposals that could prove more controversial apart from calls to reverse the newly narrow definition of domestic abuse two of them to make stalking a criminal offence and to introduce a new right of appeal against bail for those accused of domestic violence are already being considered by either the home office or the courts it is the call to introduce clares law which would give women and men the right to know if their partner had a history of serial domestic abuse that is likely to raise civil liberties hackles it was named after a woman brutally murdered by a man she met on facebook cooper says we want to make sure women are safe from repeated victimisation i have talked to women who say the pressure on them only eased when their ex met a new partner yet that new partner has no way unless she has children of finding out the proposal follows others in which cooper has sought to position labour as the party of law and order she has also used an issue the rights of women that taps into the antipathy towards the wealthy backgrounds and traditional views of conservatism she knows that saying that etoneducated cameron and his even wealthier chancellor are simply out of touch with the reality of womens lives strikes a political chord asked why they are getting it so wrong over women she says theyve got far too few women in government they just dont get it and have absolutely no idea what it means say if a nursery closes she hoots with laughter about the need for a special adviser on the issue you can just imagine them pacing the corridors of parliament desperate to find some women to come and tell them what the problems were before adding no cabinet with harriet harman in it would need to do that female tory mps struggling to be heard by sections of their party speak with grudging admiration of coopers skill in sounding like someone who earns a relatively low wage and uses the night bus rather than a highly educated career politician her life has been relatively rarified a first at balliol oxford and then straight to a career in politics after a brief stint at the independent but she sends her children to a oncefailing state school and has been spotted on a bus since leaving office after a barnstorming speech at labour party conference the telegraph accused her of adopting a northern accent to go with her constituency despite being brought up in hampshire there was no sign of it on my recording she does have slightly unusual vowel sounds jost for just but even that seems more normal than the presumed estuary english of almost every posh politician her success so far has prompted the inevitable leadership question she famously declined to stand last time citing the age of her three young children has she changed her mind i want to be home secretary she says through only slightly gritted teeth thats the job i want to do and that means weve got to get the party elected again eds doing a great job as leader and what you need is a good team and for me that means doing this job suggestions to the contrary are just mischief from the tories in a way it is brave that she has focused on womens issues given her dislike of bringing her children or lifestyle into the spotlight i dont feel that its a sign of weakness to be concerned about issues that affect womens lives issues that sometimes dont get taken seriously because they largely affect women she rarely talks about her children although she has told of an earlymorning today programme interview in which she had to slam the door on an injured child who proceeded to scream throughout i wont say what my daughter thinks of that but ive never done an interview from home again her marriage to a political colleague provokes inevitable questions given her mastery of the economic brief did she not want his job of shadow chancellor i enjoyed doing economic jobs in government but im keen to do something different in opposition she says without much of a smile she does admit to being asked different questions however the dimbleby gaffe made her roar but why didnt she complain it was a very short interview and i thought it was more important to get some points across about what was happening in

government policies and a series of legislative changes are putting womens lives at risk according to campaign groups and research by the labour party proposed changes to legal aid which campaigners believe will make it harder for victims of domestic violence to gain financial support and cuts to local authority services have come under fire on the international day for the elimination of violence against women in a letter to the guardian womens groups including the end violence against women coalition the national federation of womens institutes and the fawcett society urge the justice secretary kenneth clarke to review proposed changes to legal aid as they fail to acknowledge that legal aid is a vital lifesaving resource for women who have experienced violence labour says cuts to policing street lighting and womens support services such as refuges will all affect womens safety the party is launching a campaign to highlight the issue on friday together with a commission to gather further evidence yvette cooper the shadow home secretary said the coalition had a blind spot when it came to services designed to help women a series of legislative changes have started to impact on womens safety and services are being more heavily cut a new commission spearheaded by the former solicitor general vera baird is to gather evidence on these relatively smallscale specialist services in lieu of any research from the home office cooper said weve done a lot of work around the economics and now were concerned about increasing evidence that the government is becoming similarly careless on womens safety the fact that a series of legislative changes has started to impact on womens safety is worrying as well as tightening the definition of domestic violence for those applying for legal aid the government plans to delete dna profiles of thousands of rape suspects under the protection of freedoms bill cooper has drawn up a personal safety and security bill whose proposals include a socalled clares law named after clare wood who was killed by a man she met on a website the law would let people find out if partners had a history of domestic violence but is likely to face objections from civil liberties groups cooper also wants government plans that would narrow the definition of domestic violence for legal aid to be reversed two other labour proposals that stalking become a crime and a right of appeal against bail for those accused of domestic violence are being considered by the home secretary theresa may and the courts following recent cases such as that of jane clough cooper accused the government of acting out of an ideological conviction that the state encourages dependence when what a lot of women know is that this kind of support can create independence legal aid could give you the independence to walk away from a violent relationship or forced marriage for example in a speech on thursday lynne featherstone the home office minister responsible for addressing international violence against women and girls said good progress had been made on the governments plan on all aspects of violence against women announced in march

so divorce has zoomed forcefully into the zimmer zone now that the only reported rise in the divorce rate in the most recent justpublished figures is in the plus age range leave aside the possibility that this is also the group that was most likely to have succumbed to marriage en masse and suddenly the dynamics of family life could begin to take on more subplots than the average soap opera imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery but presumably not when your newly silver separated freshly retired pilatesproofed and therefore very fit mother is pursuing the same pool of men as you and mother may have the added advantage that she comes with no strings attached since shes done babies and orange blossom has no interest in ivf and no longer seeks a househusband to sort out the domestic engineering while she builds her fledgling career of course men have long shed housewife number one for a younger ubermodel now it seems women too better prepared by a lifetime of earning their own money and making their own way in the world of work are happy to take the step from i do to i definitely dont any more while only of divorces are among the overs the rate of disengagement is growing fast of course for some divorcees male and female loneliness and families fractured beyond repair may ensue but ironically if the marriage has had more of the better moments than the bad if commitment helped to weather the relationship once romance waned a tad then thats exactly the kind of apprenticeship that may help to make the most of whatever life serves up next so many of the more

polls show the government is unpopular with women with david cameron expected to hire a female adviser shortly where did it all go wrong tory mp amber rudd and activist kat banyard find little common ground susanna rustin chairs kat banyard women are facing cuts to jobs benefits and public services they rely on more than men so of course were seeing plummeting support for conservatives if the government is serious about increasing womens voice in parliament it should reinstate the womens national commission amber rudd the best way to make policy that has women at the centre is to have women involved i find it very perplexing that were doing so badly with women in the polls the only reason i can see is that women tend to have responsibility for family budgets and incomes are being squeezed women are responding to that theyre not interested particularly in the reasons theyre just punishing the government kb women are incredibly interested in why its happening and the fact that its happening disproportionately to them the bulk of jobs lost in the public sector have been womens and the bulk of the benefits cut are those that mostly women rely on i take your point about more women in parliament but theres only been a increase in women mps since so its basically ground to a halt look at david camerons cabinet just five out of a strong cabinet are women out of ministerial posts ar the huge intake of women in was because labour had a huge majority it was a oneoff achievement if you can achieve equality without allwomen shortlists its much better because you bring people with you i find it extraordinary that labour is carrying on doing allwomen shortlists when its just not necessary because you can go before a selection committee as i did and win against the men kb cameron has said in the past that if the softer measures dont work he will look at quotas and the soft measures arent working a girl born today will be drawing her pension before she is equally represented in parliament ar what im trying to do is get women involved earlier on when i go and talk to schools i always say to the girls start thinking about it now its up to politicians and activists like us to get as many young women involved as possible susanna rustin would more women in parliament mean womenfriendly policies would automatically follow ar the reason womens issues and working lives were addressed by labour after is there were more women in parliament now weve got more women in senior roles in the conservative party that will make a difference i describe myself as a feminist feminism got me started on wanting to be fair about opportunities i think the party of feminism is the conservative party kb but the conservative partys economic policy is an attack on womens economic independence there are m women out of work weve seen sure start centres close their doors ar were increasing the number of rape crisis centres and when we introduce the universal credit in women will get childcare support when they start working the point of universal credit is to help working women because as you know a lot of women feel theres no point working more than hours a week raising the tax threshold will take million people out of tax of them women when labour abolished the p tax rate of those affected were women so i dont accept the conservative party is always against women sr do you accept the cuts have a disproportionate effect on women because more women work in the public sector and more of us depend on the state ar its a difficult time but this government is trying to focus what money there is on the lowest paid we should be thinking how can we help women get into better jobs or what can we do about childcare the three words i would love to hear the chancellor say most are taxfree childcare kb twothirds of the jobs lost in local authorities since the first quarter of have been womens ar this government is trying to reinvigorate the private sector which should be employing women at every level kb youre saying the solution is the private sector but the pay gap in the private sector is nearly double that in the public sector we need hard measures to tackle the gender pay gap such as forcing companies to report on their pay differentials we also need alternatives to the cuts i dont think women are buying it ar clearly the evidence is that theyre not but i believe we have to make these savings in order to secure our countrys debt what matters most to women i believe is the economy is jobs sr if you dont believe the policies are the problem is it that women dont like david cameron and george osborne ar i dont think so i come back to budgets the last government tried to deal with poverty by raising welfare standards by giving money out this government is trying to deal with poverty by helping families back into work sr so what is the point of a female special adviser ar its about promoting these policies kb the government needs more than a pr job it needs emergency measures to stop the disproportionate impact of the cuts on women ringfencing sure starts and making sure local authorities cant cut domestic violence services ar we can do more in terms of pushing for transparency on pay i am very ambitious about getting more women into highly paid jobs and theresa may has announced a scheme for mentors to stimulate businesses to employ women sr whats the atmosphere like among tory women mps is there a feeling of sisterhood ar there is and we naturally stop and talk to each other im working on a project

in dr jerome teelucksingh an academic from port of spain trinidad had an idea he imagined one day of the year when the world would address male genderspecific problems and celebrate positive male role models on the date of his late fathers birthday november he organised an event at port of spain university in the years since international mens day imd has spread to at least countries but despite winning the blessing of the un it is far from the best publicised or funded event on the global calendar indeed it probably comes as news to you that it is happening at all but if youre lucky there may be activities happening close to you tomorrow so this week i posed a simple question to the hive mind of twitter what do you think of imd from the dozens of responses a grand total of four were broadly supportive the majority were dismissive jocular or mocking and about a quarter were actively hostile before conducting that unscientific experiment i had been ambivalent but the balance of replies convinced me imd is necessary and deserving of support precisely because so few people believe it is needed inevitably the commonest response was some variation on i thought every day was international mens day and i dont dispute that for days a year men dominate power structures and the public agenda the media pores over the movers and shakers of politics economics entertainment industry and sport all of them disproportionately men but my issue here is not who is doing the talking but what they are not talking about for individually or collectively the one thing men rarely do is talk about our problems so what should be up for discussion on imd malespecific health issues are the most obvious answer and it is fortuitous that imd falls bang in the middle of movember the cancer charity tacheothon raising awareness and research funding for prostate or testicular cancer is uncontroversial but the focus could be widened to include suicide rates and depression sexual dysfunction takeup of primary healthcare and early interventions then there are the political issues toleration of prison rape child visitation and custody policy underachievement of boys in education death and injury at work provision of domestic violence and abuse services to male victims the list goes on this is all starting to sound a bit depressing so lets look at the positives there may be no shortage of celebrations of male sporting entrepreneurial or political prowess but wouldnt we all benefit from an annual opportunity to acknowledge the handson and stayathome dads the charity volunteers the community sports coaches or in a more traditional vein those who risk their lives daily in the lifeboats and mountain rescue teams or in the mines and on the merchant ships doing the most dangerous and frightening jobs often with scant recognition one of the great social and political challenges of the th century was to reimagine and reinvent our working and domestic arrangements in line with changing gender roles one of the greatest sociopsychological challenges of the st century is to create new models of masculinity more in keeping with this new world much has been said perhaps too much about the supposed crisis of masculinity our gender identity is not in crisis but it is in flux there is plenty to admire and cherish in traditional masculine roles from courage and strength to stoicism and selfsacrifice and the key may be to find ways to incorporate the best of what we used to be with the best of what we would like to be to do so requires opening spaces for discussion not being afraid to lift the lid on some wormy cans and talk positively about what it means to be a man imd might be a good place to start for this day to be fruitful though one ground rule must be observed by supporters and sceptics alike these issues stand on their own merit not in comparison to other causes in a hierarchy of injustice nobody suggests that world aids day somehow diminishes world mental health day or implies that aids is a more pressing concern than cancer or malaria people can celebrate all that is good about irish culture on st patricks day without anyone claiming it is an insult to the english or to the welsh the same must be true of imd have a good day fellas this article was commissioned following a suggestion made by peterjackson if theres a

she has been called the mother of british feminism so it is perhaps fitting that her image was blasted onto the building known in some parts as the mother of all parliaments mary wollstonecrafts image was projected onto the palace of westminster during wednesdays rush hour to raise money for another image the first ever statue of the author of the vindication of the rights of women campaigners are aiming to raise to pay for the statuary on newington green in north london near the site of wollstonecrafts former home and the school where the radical thcentury campaigner taught they also spent two hours handing out leaflets and promoting the fact that supportive mps have already signed a petition including jeremy corbyn mp who masterminded the turning out of the lights overlooking the thames statues dont tend to get much publicity in the uk unless it is trafalgar squares fourth plinth but this campaign called mary on the green does raise questions about the number of women immortalised in stone of the public outdoor sculptures of famous people in the us for example only or less than are of women compared with of men according to the smithsonian american art museums art inventories catalog i cant find equivalent stats for the uk can anyone help earlier this year lynette long a washington area psychologist and founder of eve equal visibility everywhere told the young feminists network in the us that this imbalance had a negative impact on young girls and their sense of equality humans tend to trust the nonverbal and the statues send a very clear nonverbal message girls cant be what they cant see she said given the fact that statues tend to commemorate political and military figures it is perhaps unsurprising that men dominate where there are statues of women they tend to be largely generic representing ideas such as freedom and of course liberty rather than individuals yet by the s there were signs that things were changing as women came to prominence the number of statues representing women increased in the us eleanor roosevelt coming to nyc in and others honouring abigail adams lucy stone and phillis wheatley at the same time statues are far less frequently erected making the chances of women catching up with men very low germaine greer has written about the uks paucity of proper female statues and the fact that even our only woman prime minister received a marble likeness in eight years after she left office and funded by a private donor although that seems politically appropriate rather than publicly sexist given this record lets hope the notinsignificant sum can be raised by mary on the green which is also to launch a design competition the last time an image of a woman made headlines for its projection on the house of commons it was a naked gail porter to promote a poll to find the worlds sexiest women at least this time it is to publicise a campaign to honour one of our most radical and important writers,2011-11,ha called mother

it feels as if for years the only argument occurring about feminism has been whether or not it has a point hadnt its purpose already been served all its battles won and when young women eschew feminism thinking it to describe an uneven temper and hairy armpits does it have any reliable meaning or future luckily with the obvious proviso that this is also very unlucky for women this argument has been thoroughly scotched since the coalition government came to power women are hardest hit by the austerity drive and always the losers whenever theres a surge of social conservatism in the light of these grim times there has been a resurgence of activism a uk feminista conference last weekend with attendees a fawcett society day of action on saturday a tuc conference yesterday launching the women and cuts toolkit while certain government members might prefer to ignore all this the coalition generally is terrified of the perception that they dont care about women as signalled by an asinine memo from no strategists about appealing to women which was leaked in september and this weeks announcement that david cameron is to appoint a special adviser to vet every policy for its impact on women she could save time i have already bet the scalp of my firstborn that it will be a she by simply consulting that tuc toolkit but i doubt that she will just as an aside im annoyed now by all the breath i wasted these last two decades arguing about whether feminism was worthwhile there will always be milquetoasts on the sidelines calling feminism irrelevant while availing themselves blithely of the rights it fights for the correct answer should have been a sprightly good luck to you sister youre the one who has to live with yourself but now feminism has been deemed relevant more interesting debates have sprung up within it the question arose last weekend would things be so bad for women if there were better female representation in the government the vote was split on one side a conviction that this is the problem in public life its overwhelmingly male middleaged and white and on that fact can be blamed all the recklessness thoughtlessness and shortsightedness that lies behind every crisis you can name i dislike any argument that seeks essential differences between the sexes to explain why one is useless and the other great its like pulling a knife on a burglar you can never be sure hes not going to use it on you but here i dislike it specifically because imagine if things were different if there were nadine dorrieses and lynne featherstones it wouldnt help look at the policy areas put forward by the coalition and how they affect women cuts to legal aid disproportionately hit women because so much of it relates to family cases and women are predominantly the party needing financial assistance its crazy isnt it anyone would think motherhood interfered with your earning potential cuts to public sector jobs hit women hardest because of women work in the public sector against of men any move towards commissioning services from the private sector instead of providing them in the public sector will affect women because the pay gap is much higher in the private sector parttime workers are paid much less in the private sector and are predominantly women cuts to the childcare element of working family tax credit hit women because theyre more likely to be the second earner and already of mothers in the lowest quintile have had to give up work because their earnings dont justify their childcare todays unemployment figures showed the number of women out of work to have hit a year high and no amount of rebranding shes not unemployed shes a stayathome mum changes that cuts to teachers pensions hit women because women are more likely to be teachers the bizarre suggestion from the department for work and pensions to charge lone parents for chasing the absent parent for maintenance would hit women because of lone parents are women the end of the ema affects women more than men because it was of particular importance to teenage mothers and i dont even have time to explain why housing benefit cuts and the universal credit will disproportionately hit women nor how the crisis in midwifery is somewhat worse for women nor the longterm effects of the closure of the care to learn scheme i dont believe the government hates women this is simply what the landscape looks like when you recast social security as benefit and refute the underlying principle that we will all at points in our lives be fiscally unproductive and its the work of society to carry us this is what it looks like when you contract public services out to the lowest bidder this is what it looks like when you roll back the rights of the employee in the workplace to boost industry there are arguments to be had about whether women are drawn to the public services and caring professions or nudged into them and whether they want to take on most of the childcare or are forced to but those are arguments we can have another time someone needs to care someone needs to nurse teach and look after children and the elderly someone needs to stick around when a marriage breaks down and while those people are needed the rest of us have to fight to make sure they dont pay for their efforts with poverty female representation in parliament is the least of

at a time of soaring female unemployment perhaps any form of job creation is to be welcomed but whoever benefits from david camerons decision to hire a special adviser for women certainly has their work cut out so what lies in her or perhaps even his intray the immediate challenge is weaning the government off hasty gimmicks such as the recent porn filter for home computers which didnt quite live up to its billing attacking overtly sexualised music videos offers a rare chance for traditional rightwingers and feminists to agree but while these issues do matter its jobs not culture wars

hit by recent cuts in the childcare subsidy provided by working tax credit airy talk of scrapping maternity leave or unfair dismissal laws just angers them further the new adviser must explain the political risk to her boss of nick clegg looking like the working womans only friend in government she might like to make the case for urgently providing more affordable childcare to keep poorer parents in work rather than scrapping a p tax rate to placate wealthy men she might even ask why a planned universal credit designed to ensure work pays could end up leaving some second earners mostly women worse off another key aim will be winning back older women infuriated by hasty changes to the pensionable age should the government match labours creation of a separate cabinet post for older people or at least find a rising star with whom older women identify especially if theresa may doesnt survive the borders scandal but the new advisers biggest task must be to avoid future clunky decisions by training ministers and officials automatically to stop and ask if any new wheeze would disproportionately hit women oh and given the suspicion with which some male mps now regard the

the breakdown in the relationship between david cameron and women voters is now well documented the alarm in tory high command can be measured in mr camerons public pronouncements when not castigating the worlds most powerful woman angela merkel he has in recent weeks confided to grazia how uncomfortably macho he finds prime ministers questions suggested british business would benefit from more women in the boardroom and promoted women in his reshuffle but its not what youre saying thats the problem mr cameron its what your governments doing part of the difficulty can be traced back to the broken britain rhetoric sustained by the welfare secretary iain duncan smith his conviction that a mass marriage programme would resolve many difficulties for the worstoff families heard again in an impassioned plea to a single mother on yesterdays world at one sadly her response was not has researchers in the field grinding their teeth the joseph rowntree foundation has produced solid research correlating marriage with higherthanaverage education and income and it is this that explains the relative success enjoyed by children of married parents the research suggests young women dont have babies for the benefits but because they have no confidence in the prospect of being able to succeed at anything else alongside a failure to reckon with this research there is a failure to consider the implications of wider policy changes on different parts of society women are being disproportionately disadvantaged by spending cuts and not just financially but as they step in to do the caring the state will no longer fund in their life chances too below the campaigners horizons there are other less obvious casualties this week the supreme court finally resolved a tortuous dispute between formerly cohabiting partners over shares in a jointly owned property but although it has sorted out jones v kernott it has done little to clarify the law it is four years since the law commission recommended that parliament end the muddle last month the justice minister jonathan djanogly announced nothing would be done as one leading practitioner blogged once again its the women who are most likely to suffer from the continuation of a widespread misunderstanding of how few rights cohabitation confers mr duncan smith had made it clear before the election that he opposes modernising the

of the hundreds of stories i was told over five years when interviewing women and girls affected by gang violence and serious youth violence julies will always stay with me to make up for the day before when hes battered me hell come back with to worth of clothes a whole new wardrobe new shoes and youre thinking i cant ever escape this this is gonna be my life for ever and its scary i thought the only way i would ever get out of it would be to kill myself i wanted it up until two months ago the only thing i regretted about that overdose was that it didnt work julie not her real name was speaking to me last year and recounting six years of gang association she had been abused and injured physically sexually emotionally and mentally by two gangassociated boyfriends throughout her teenage years it wasnt until she tried to commit suicide for the second time that she was taken into an adult service for violence against women and supported to recover julie had been in contact with a range of services during her short life youth offending services social services education sexual health the police housing drug and alcohol misuse to name a few she was known as a troublesome teenager but her gangassociation had never been identified why would it she was a girl it is not often that you see stark progress in social policy change can be incremental cautious and frustrating services have historically struggled to identify and respond to the impact of gang violence on women and girls raped and sexually exploited coerced to hold firearms and drugs threatened to provide alibis and lured by the belief that they will be protected and cared for gangaffected girls have been abused and have perpetrated crimes under the radar with girls seen as a prop rather than as integral to the causes and consequences of youth violence some professionals and decision makers have focused activity on males who are perceived as central to all solutions gang violence projects designed to work with men and boys certainly left some professionals i met feeling illequipped to keep girls safe but following last weeks publication of theresa mays strategy to end gang and youth violence it is evident that the tide could be changing the plan features specific actions for responding to girls victimisation and offending committing funding to developing specialist services and recognising the support needed for boys and girls to challenge the stereotypes of masculinity that can underpin the violent control and coercion in gang contexts the translation of girls voices from research into policy has begun and professionals must ensure it is not lost in operation to meet the vision outlined council and police authority areas will be expected to consider whether their risk assessments for identifying gangaffected children enable them to find girls in danger question if services are appropriate and begin to collect data on gangassociated females the challenge for professionals working with young people and violence against women is to convert this strategic position into an operational reality for some professionals there will be a steep learning curve to build expertise and understand the gender and age specific needs of gangaffected young women support through training and professional partnerships will be required to bolster the confidence and capacity of practitioners but if girls can be identified helped to recover and their involvement in serious youth violence prevented lives could be saved carlene firmin is a principal policy adviser

and so the inevitable fightback after several female writers broke cover to discuss the abuse they have received on the web from rape and death threats to insults over their looks and livelihoods the guardian assembled a panel to write about the issue of sexism online and the slurs began brendan oneill blogging for the telegraph summed it up when he compared those who couldnt take online invective with saltssmelling victorians faced with a bare ankle these fragile and peculiarly sensitive female bloggers are a threat to freedom of speech he argues the crashing together of threats of violence with ridicule is striking because it exposes a fairly orwellian streak to modern feminist campaigns to stamp out bad things muddying the historic philosophical distinction between words and actions which has informed enlightened thinking for hundreds of years is too high a price to pay just so some feminist bloggers can surf the web without having their delicate sensibilities riled his comments provoked a brilliant response from sady doyle the writer who dreamed up the now trending hashtag mencallmethings do read it here in essence doyle argues that the abuse whether foul threats of actual violence or more common insults has one thing in common they are attempts to shut women up as such they are part of an ageold pattern of behaviour in which womens voices are more shrill more whiny and just a bit pathetic rather than a reasoned and authoritative account of ones personal experience there is an interesting subplot to the debate though and that is the argument that can perhaps be summed up as its the internet innit the idea that the web still a new frontier changing the nature of public and personal discourse allows and indeed encourages frank and deeply uncivil conversation in a sort of st century wild west is not just held by people who think women should just get on with it and shut up helen lewis hasteley who did us all a great service by asking other female bloggers about their experience reports on a conversation with the guardians own james ball in which he says when netizens want to get personal they hone in on any easy target race age class or of course gender that might get them a rise he says even middleaged white men debatably the least persecuted minority out there are susceptible to abuse what do you know about anything in your ivory tower and hes right in many ways its the ultimate weapon of the bully isnt it to pick on the perceived weakness of another and shut them down anonymity just allows the bully to hide even more yet on this blog an experimental affair that was begun to celebrate international womens day in march as well as some of the guardians own coverage of womens issues i have never felt threatened or afraid indeed ive often been cheered by the nature of debate when readers take issue with each other as well as me some of the best comments about name changing for example or women at work have taught me a lot and made me rethink my position please please continue as they are the best antidote to those who use the web to get their kicks out of name calling but it may be because i ignore most that say and i paraphrase another stupid comment from a stupid woman or one of my favourites why do you hate white men perhaps weirdly the only one ive been moved to contradict was the suggestion that i was some product of a wealthy home and an elite education like all my colleagues is it less shamefulmore acceptable to take issue with a wrongful suggestion over class and background than it is over my status as a woman these are big issues i have sympathy with those that point out that other groups ethnic minorities gay people people with disabilities to name a few also suffer abuse but that doesnt negate the horror of misognystic abuse does it if we ignore it because we dont want to be seen as pathetic lacking in toughness or lacking balls in that nonotverysexist cliche then we will have no part in

a few months ago i would have been far more likely to be standing outside the miss world venue protesting at the event than attending it i first entered a miss england regional pageant in april in order to research a project for a module on the history of gender at the university of warwick like the women standing outside earls court yesterday i believed that pageants were degrading and humiliating to the young women involved and i was adamant that my experience would prove me correct yet i attended the miss world ceremony last night as both a titleholder and a strong advocate of the industry so what was it that changed my views so drastically it was predominantly through meeting other miss england contestants across the country far from being superficial or unintelligent as i imagined they would be i discovered a network of people that are motivated by the desire to contribute to their community and be a part of something positive young men and women come together to seek recognition for their accomplishments represent views or causes that are important to them and participate in friendly competition to win the honour of representing their town city or country i am often asked how my identity as a beauty queen and my identity as a feminist coincide i believe wholeheartedly that pageants and womens rights can go hand in hand i consider myself a feminist as i believe a woman should be equal to a man in the ability to make the life choices that fulfil her whether this leads her to remaining at home with her children sitting in the boardroom of a multinational company or by taking part in pageants and using her personal attributes to benefit herself and those around her once the feminist movement begins denying personal choice to women by demanding they reject all conventional gender ideals feminism becomes just as restrictive to women as sexism there are of course superficial elements to a pageant but generally the purpose of mr and miss england and miss world is to celebrate the diversity of appearances within the world not to push a stringent ideal of beauty pageant culture as a whole seeks to help women embrace their unique beauty and be proud of their individuality rebecca mordan who helped organise the protest outside earls court last night is wrong when she says that women are reduced to the sum of their parts while physical attractiveness is an aspect of pageants the mind and the body are not viewed separately a contestant must demonstrate a wide range of abilities and qualities beyond their appearance pageants award far more than beauty there is an award for example for those who demonstrate an outstanding dedication to charity or show themselves to be particularly accomplished in the arts sport or academia the weight placed on the importance of intelligence within pageants is illustrated neatly by the number of women in miss england and miss world who have obtained or are in the process of obtaining degrees i did not win the miss durham title because i was the most beautiful girl in the room i wasnt but i demonstrated that i was worthy of representing my city through being eloquent confident and dedicated to being a positive role model to younger members of my community not enough is done in this country to celebrate young people and to recognise their achievements to have the opportunity to stand on a stage and say this is me this is who i am and what i look like i am proud of myself is empowering beyond imagination across the world people choose to enter pageants because of the personal benefits they gain through the experience every contestant gains confidence friendship and a broadened mind having the opportunity to be involved in a pageant is the real prize winning is just a

theres a lot in a name as a form of identification names provide a fine service more personable than a numbering system to billion and one that prevents social interaction from degenerating into you the one with the hair and a range of vague descriptions they arent without their problems though none more of a quagmire than what happens to a womans name if she gets married though sense would respond with nothing why should it when it comes to marriage and female autonomy sense has no place the reasons that were used to justify a woman losing her name up until the midth century are in the modern context irrelevant few couples wake up in a cold sweat over proving an heir and who will inherit the land and the town house despite what fathers still giving away their daughters suggests if you rank peoples reasons for saying i do passing a woman between estates most likely wont even make the top three in our minds at least marriage has moved on the same however cant be said for what we do with our names despite an estimated of uk brides bucking the trend be it in law or culture the assumption that a woman will take her husbands name persists youll do well to find a newlywed who isnt greeted with mrs despite having no intention to be anything but a ms the decision to keep her name still perceived as different enough to be of note faced with the patriarchal status quo and the warm glow of history it seems we cant help but get a little teary slotted somewhere next to the thinking that a wedding is a womans chance to finally be a princess its apparently a sign of love to sacrifice the name thats been yours since birth as pop tells young girls a mans name is the ultimate gift some would be concerned for the state of modern romance id suggest starting with squashed flowers from the local garage and working up from there ultimately of course the pull is tradition the antiquated past in this case being a positive to embrace tradition however can be abandoned if indoor toilets and women no longer being tethered to the sink have taught us anything there might be even be benefits to it far more fun than thank you cards there can be no greater postwedding game than sitting down rejecting convention and figuring out what youre going to be called the obvious option is to keep your name as it was before it has the advantage of respecting both genders as equal and most importantly allows girls you havent spoken to since school to still be recognisable on social networking sites for many theres an appeal in the change though of the sense of family unit that comes in not only sharing a home but a name its a strategy of particular use if children come along allowing you to avoid the fight between names that usually results in the one enduring childbirth having theirs consigned to the dustbin of life doublebarrelling is a classic for this purpose though in ducking feminism and entering straight into class warfare it isnt without problems of its own some men have started to take their wifes name and the world as yet hasnt ended that they have to do it via deed poll rather than the simple tick of a box offered to women just ensures the law can confirm theyre indeed weird luckily the newest marital name trend has ensured the long search for a solution is over couples are now meshing blending the key syllables of both of their surnames to form a brand new sparkling one for the romantics its the ultimate union and allows the fortunate to discard the shackles of mediocrity and swap granger and den for danger its the same principle used by the media to morph the first name of celebrities you and your betrothed will be just like brangelina but instead of gossip spreads youll have bank statements when my own sister married ben and gave up the ryan name it seemed only natural he would from that day be known as bryan the possibilities are endless this is your chance to get creative to find something better than a tradition that says

david cameron has been told a strong coalition of charities academics womens groups and unions led by the campaigning charity the fawcett society has warned the prime minister that the female electorate is facing the greatest risk to their financial security in living memory the fawcett report a life raft for womens equality lists the carnage of this war on women a war that is costing the conservatives dearly as its female support slides away the number of outofwork women has reached a year high of million while half of mothers still working full time say they may have to stop or go part time because of a reduction in the childcare subsidy in addition there have been cuts to child benefit of sure start childrens centres have closed a maternity grant for lowincome families has been axed and housing benefit has been reduced saving bn but making almost million women worse off women have been particularly badly hit by cuts that affect up to bn out of the bn sliced from the welfare budget the consequence of this is plain returning more women to the home means fewer women in paid work lower tax revenues and a higher benefits bill not what britain needs research on what helped to ease poverty and improve life chances under the former labour government shines a light on precisely those areas that are now being hardest hit by the cuts britain has a very significant number of people on low pay rates while of parents work untypical hours otherwise known as the dawn graveyard and weekend shifts the tradeoff for rotten wages under labour were supplements from working families tax credits subsidised childcare a minimum wage and a significant investment in early years now cut by via sure start and childrens centres the labour inheritance is the current popular offer of hours of free childcare for all three and fouryearolds as these valuable foundations are now desperately weakened by the cuts there is also anxiety about the replacement of an admittedly complex web of benefits with a single payment the universal credit in the benefit is calculated on family income and may discourage a second parttime earner from taking up paid work another direct hit on women theresa may the home secretary and womens and equalities minister has responded with the announcement that she is setting up a womens business council and recruiting mentors to help female entrepreneurs in a speech on friday she also conceded that women who wanted to increase their hours were stuck in parttime jobs resulting in bn a year in lost skills and she robustly defended parental leave and the need for flexible work but as she well knows advisers and empathy make a thin brew the tide of female discontent with the coalition continues to rise among the measures

theresa may announced a package of measures on friday that aspires to help women fulfil their potential in business as a report accused her government of undermining human rights the home secretary who is also the womens and equalities minister outlined a m scheme that will see volunteer mentors trained by next year to provide role models for female entrepreneurs the announcement comes as polls indicate that many women have become increasingly disillusioned with david cameron and the cuts programme it coincides with the release of a report by the fawcett society warning that womens rights are under unprecedented attack amid growing evidence that austerity measures are turning back time on equality may told businesswomen at the royal commonwealth society in central london that the training and support material used by the new business mentors to help those wanting to set up or expand their own business will reflect the specific needs of women business people tell us that they want to take advice from other business people said may so the business mentors will be experienced individuals who can provide tailored support and advice they will be a huge help to women entrepreneurs she also said that the government would introduce a womens business council for too long as a country we have failed to make the most of the skills experience and talents of women and despite the difficult decisions that need to be taken there is much we can do to make sure that our economy emerges stronger and fairer and operates in the interests of the working majority change will not be easy and it will not be quick it will take a comprehensive effort to tear down the barriers women tell us they face she said the home secretary said she wanted to help all women not just the highest earners by increasing flexible working and flexible parental leave she stressed that it isnt just a question of fairness its also one of economic strength too many women who are working parttime dont feel they can go fulltime or those with a great business idea do not feel able to strike out on their own and start their own company this means that too many women do not fulfil their true potential the policies i have talked about today like flexible working and flexible parental leave will help they will make a real practical difference she said the fawcett society report released on friday claimed that womens financial security and human rights are under attack on a scale not seen in living memory it claimed to show how government cuts have pushed women out of the workforce driven down their income and undermined hardwon access to justice the number of women out of work is at a year high twothirds of local authority jobs cut by local councils since the first quarter of were held by women entitled a life raft for womens equality the fawcett report claimed to offer key policy recommendations to reverse the impact of cuts on women these included ringfencing

as a feminist i dont think that celebrity selfeviscerator liz jones has any business starting sentences with the words as a feminist but nobody checks these things with me so shes done it anyway in yesterdays terrifying confessional about her secret life as a sperm stealer as a feminist says jones i looked down on mumsy types proving straight away that she definitely isnt a feminist and that the word should be checked into a refuge to protect it from her abuses mumsy is one of the more invidious antifemale insults that go round there is of course no male version no one with outie genitalia and a tendency to procreate finds himself dismissed as dadsy which doesnt even sound like it should be a word but mumsy sidles into conversation pretending it isnt really demeaning because well because if you are a mum and you enjoy being a mum then you cant really be offended by somebody saying that youre like a mum but if someone calls you mumsy theyre clearly not paying tribute to your awesome nurturing powers its a way of saying that a woman with a child has become nothing but a mother it means sexless floral smocks it means a retreat from the grownup world into the smallscale dramas of playgroup places and chunky crayons it means fatally that youve given some sort of public confirmation of your possession of a uterus and now anyone who doesnt fancy listening to you can instead wallop you with your reproductive organs like a very muscular balloon on a stick mumsy thwack mumsy thwack mumsy sorry were you trying to say something thwack among the whole mess of reasons women lag behind men in earnings and promotions inequitable attitudes to parenthood rate highly the default assumption is that she will take more time off she will look after the bulk of the childcare she will be the difficult employee importantly even if youre a happily childfree woman you will still suffer from the prejudices of bosses and coworkers who dont believe you any woman using the mword is pitching her lot in with this creeping maternal essentialism this idea that having a womb is the opposite of being a person precisely shes being a misogynist jones isnt alone in this people with much more robust feminist bona fides will join in with the thwacking having had oranges are not the only fruit thrust on me at university as a feminist set text i remember a skullrending sense of cognitive dissonance when i got to the narrators encounter with her exlover melanie now married and pushing a pram if she had been serene to the point of bovine before she was now almost vegetable writes winterson hang on i thought in a muddied undergraduate way how can this be a great feminist text if its implying that pregnancy and childbirth the one thing that definitively separates male and female existence will turn me into an ambulant pumpkin the big secret is that having a baby wont change you that much wanting loving and raising a child that can be transformative but quickening thickening and giving birth isnt going to give your life any meaning it didnt have before the mistake people like jones make both in her notreallyafeminist days and in the later babychasing condomshucking era is believing that a woman evolves a new personality when her milk comes in clearly thats nonsense if you were an idiot prepartum lets say stupid enough to chuck mumsy around with a

the protest in against the miss world beauty pageants in london was a galvanising moment in the womens liberation movement as the host bob hope asked the contestants girls will you turn around in

is feel free to hate me on twitter liz jones whom i have never met has spent decades revealing her neuroses and nefarious behaviour as other hacks hide in the trenches rewriting press releases or fawning over the latest product theyve been sent jones is running naked into no mans land which could have been named after her love life shrieking variously i loved my cats more than my husband im anorexic i had a facelift im nearly bankrupt my personal life is an utter shambles and im too deranged to turn it around each week in my head i thank her no one makes me feel better about myself than liz jones no one else reminds me that whatever lofi lunacy prevents me from achieving complete personal fulfilment it could all be so much worse i could be liz jones do we really want another flaccid whimsical columnist farting out vague nonsense about their beta personality i dont i want monstrous confessions i want to hear other humans at their most depraved selfish and awful i want detail cold and brutal about the inner lives of others i want to be aghast and i suspect you do too but those shouting jones down are too blinded by what she confesses rather than the fact that she confesses it to recognise how brilliant and valuable she is few appreciate what sacrifices are made for that level of honesty i have some experience here i have written in ways i could never say out loud to another human about being attacked by burglars about my pathological messiness my addiction to sleeping pills my misery at going bald and for three years in a column for attitude and then gay times about the men i dated and slept with only when your father has rung you up after accidentally reading about a hand shandy you gave someone who works in public relations can you fully understand joness courage i am aware how ridiculous that sounds we whine about dishonesty in public life about the chasm between political rhetoric and personal morality we rage at footballers and mps who parade their family in the media only to be found bedding a big brother contestant so how about for once we applaud a woman who shares that which most people let alone journalists would scarcely even admit to themselves there is laugh if you like a political dimension here the personal really is the political for a woman like jones to put a webcam in her subconscious so that a nation can see how damaged she is by the patriarchy by her relationships with men by the fashion and beauty industry by the media and yes by her own unique inability to be a functional adult is to provide a powerful evocation

an end to the same group of men rotating in the boardroom would help end the scandal of excess executive pay david cameron said on wednesday before a coalition meeting calling for a new drive to increase women on company boards responding to calls by the labour leader ed miliband to propose a specific move against boardroom excesses cameron said he wanted to end the closed circle that entailed a regular list of men endorsing one anothers executive pay he said the answer was much more transparency about the levels of pay much more accountability and strengthening the hand of shareholders he added there is something else we need to do which is to make sure nonexecutive directors on boards are not the usual sort of rotating list of men patting each others backs and increasing the level of remuneration i want to see more women in britains boardrooms which i think would have a thoroughly good influence the prime ministers spokesman said cameron was not saying just that women were paid less than men but that decisions about boardroom pay should be open to a wider set of influences his remarks came before a breakfast meeting on thursday of women in boardrooms hosted by lord davies the former trade and industry minister as part of his drive to increase female representation davies published a report in february saying ftse firms should aim for a minimum of female board representation by firms should fully disclose the number of women on their boards and in their organisations as a whole to drive up the numbers with top jobs he said the debate has not only caught peoples imagination but with proper mentoring and training will drive real change in the corporate world the latest surveys show of all board appointments between march and october were of women women make up of ftse directors up from in women make up of ftse directors up from in there are allmale boards in the ftse down from in of ftse firms have allmale boards and only a third of ftse firms have set targets for increasing womens numbers in the boardroom female directors overall earn salaries lower than those of men rising to for executive directors a gap according to the institute of directors and croner reward other studies suggest men also get higher bonuses cameron linked boardroom greed and the role of men the day after tory women mps visited downing street to discuss why the party was trailing among women voters one idea canvassed by some of the mps was for a special adviser in downing street dedicated to womens issues and responsible for feminising all announcements across whitehall they would also like to see the prime minister restrain some of the hatchet rhetoric coming from cabinet there is no simple explanation as to why cameron is doing so poorly with women but the most frequent claim is that a tough deficit reduction programme including deep publicspending cuts comes across as harsh to female voters the collapse of conservative ratings with regard to the health service due to reforms advanced by the health secretary andrew lansley is also thought by tory women mps to be an avoidable disaster the guardian icm poll for october shows that for women voters labour is on points the tories and liberal democrats among a similar group of male voters labour has the conservatives and lib dems the same poll shows women are less confident than men at keeping up with the cost of living the business secretary vince cable is consulting on measures to tame boardroom pay and will refer to what is expected to be an influential report this month from the high pay commission the product of a yearlong inquiry into top pay in the private sector this article was amended on november the original described lord davies as the industry minister he is a former

more women than men go to university in the uk and the us and tend to outlive them yet men still dominate economic and political leadership according to a report on the global gender gap released on tuesday the nordic countries that top the world economic forums global gender gap index iceland norway finland and sweden respectively all see women paid as much as men while occupying as many senior jobs in business management or the judiciary for example the report which ranked countries according to salaries workforce participation access to education representation in decisionmaking structures life expectancy and sex ratio cited government policies that encourage women to return to work after having children as well as outlawing workplace discrimination while many developed economies have succeeded in closing the gender gap in education few have succeeded in maximising the returns from this investment the report found the nordic countries are leaders in this area on the whole these economies have made it possible for parents to combine work and family the top four countries offer mandatory paternity leave relatively generous parental leave benefits tax incentives and postmaternity reentry programmes in the uk more women than men enter university but lag behind in seniority as well as wage equality the uk ranked rd behind such countries as the philippines and mozambique for economic participation and opportunity but was among several developed countries to share the top slot for educational attainment with more women than men enrolling for tertiary or university education the us did better in terms of women in the workplace but ranked lower than the uk for political power the uk which slipped to th from th place in this years league table was awarded points for the length of time it had a female prime minister for example there are signs of improvement around the world with countries closing the gap since the world economic forum started to compile the index six years ago as part of a bid to encourage female participation klaus schwab founder and chairman of the wef which meets in davos every year said a world where women make up less than of the global decisionmakers is a world that is missing a huge opportunity for growth and ignoring an untapped reservoir of potential in an interview ahead of todays release saadia zahidi head of the world economic forums women leaders and gender parity programme and the reports coauthor said closing the gap is not a luxury good just for high end companies and countries smaller gender gaps are directly correlated with increased economic competitiveness yet the gap is not just economic with a far larger inequality in wealthy countries such as saudi arabia where women are not yet able to vote or drive than poor ones such as lesotho which ranks ninth overall well above the uk and us having had a brief look at the results of this survey im not sure yet what puts lesotho in the top and im

britains boardrooms are white and male so predominantly is parliament and government and so are the people who run television and newspapers as well as those who perform manage the arts or sit as senior judges the national public discourse is still largely conducted by a monocultural middleclass masculine elite often this is treated as a challenge for women as half the workforce they are the most obviously disadvantaged but it might be easier to change if it was seen less as a question of gender and more as matter of diversity the statistics are familiar enough plenty of women go out into the workplace on level terms with men only to fall away in the middle years leaving the boardrooms spokesmen claim struggling to find women of experience to promote enlightened management insists the shortage of women is not for want of trying flexible working career breaks theyve tried it all and ungrateful women still walk away under pressure from europe and the government and worried that quotas might be imposed some city companies have started to think creatively about the real barriers that hold women back the findings of qualitative surveys like the ones done for the women matter series by mckinsey consultants tell a more complex story than the one about worklife balance more women are being taken on at the bottom in the law medicine journalism and the city women are recruited in equal numbers its the second or third round of promotions where women begin to fall away the mckinsey work found it wasnt lack of ambition that stops women more a lack of confidence in being able to fulfil that ambition and not enough role models showing them the way mentoring coaching and sponsorship are all important to stop women taking another job or going in another direction so is dealing with embedded prejudices among senior managers about the risk of employing women but above all what matters is counting and measuring knowing how many women start what happens to them and why they leave this is just as true for minorities as for gender its about the way powerful networks replicate themselves understanding that could help break down the monoculture at the top and create a real diversity there was disappointment when the governmentcommissioned davies report failed to recommend quotas to drive up the number of women in the boardroom the equality and human rights commission reckons it will take years to win parity at the current rate but it has good ideas about mentoring and monitoring the next battle is to make sure that they are about not just women but

grindr is a smartphone app that allows men to find each other for dating socialising and friendship walk into a pub and your phone literally gives you photos of everyone there whos grinding when it was launched in the guardian wrote of a new sexual revolution a year later that doesnt seem that far off the mark among the gay male community in the uk these days grindr is not so much popular as practically compulsory nearly million men are signed up globally and the uk is one of the biggest markets at a rough estimate half of all of londons gay and bi men are members though the figures may be skewed by the fact that apparently straight men sign up too for reasons known only to themselves and for the past year or so the people behind grindr have been promising to take the obvious next step and create a version for women who want to find women but it hasnt turned up theyve released blendr which says its for straight and lesbian users but its really a malefemale app with no focus on queer women and a friend who uses it gives the offputting report that it has too many penis pics have other apps jumped on the grindr bandwagon yes but the ones aimed at queer women have mostly fallen off it again theres qrushr girls but its address now redirects you to an insurance site theres another called brenda but a recent iphone app review complains that most of the people using it are men so is it just that nobody wants a piece of technology that tells gay and bi women how many other gay and bi women are nearby actually the internet is full of people asking for that very thing and the numbers add up at the most conservative estimate there are hundreds of thousands of nonstraight women in the uk alone and they cant all be monogamously partnered if uk men can join grindr youd think that at least a few thousand would sign up to its female equivalent but they havent done so why theres an obvious answer to the question of course its popularly believed that gay men embody male sexuality distilled into its purest least emotional form the calvados to heterosexualitys cider gay women are on the opposite end of the spectrum the apple juice if you like they embody female sexuality gentle meaningful pairbonded but lazy drinkbased stereotypes aside its not that women never want casual sex what they dont want is bad casual sex or unsafe casual sex or casual sex in which the other participant regards them as basically a blowup doll with very realistic skin tone and for all kinds of reasons these issues are somewhat less likely to crop up when men arent involved a recent study threw an interesting light on this researchers set up a trial of men propositioning women women propositioning men and women propositioning heterosexual women unsurprisingly the men were far more likely to accept casual sex with women than women were with men but heterosexual women were just as likely to say yes to women as they were to men bisexual women when propositioned by men and by women were more likely to say yes to women why because the important factors for the women were first the element of danger involved and second how good the person was likely to be in bed women were perceived as both less dangerous and more likely to be good in bed so oddly women who chat up women might well have just as much or as little success as men who chat up women even though nonheterosexual women are a small minority but in practice of course women dont usually try to chat up women unless they already have reason to think theyre at least a bit queer which again is where an app like grindr would come in useful there would be nondating uses too if youre a member of a smallish ofteninvisible minority the ability to walk into a cafe pub shopping centre or office and identify fellow members would at the very least be interesting at best it could add an element of reassurance and safety it could even help to create a new kind of womens community with lesbian hangouts such as first out in london closing down the ability to create a corner of any given pub that is forever lgbt cant be underestimated given all this id be interested to know why nobodys yet managed to create a successful version of grindr for women perhaps developers are largely male and dont really understand femalefemale dating and how different it is from femalemale and malemale dating maybe its the lack of research into how women date other women or is it that women themselves are suspicious of the technology and its infiltration by men looking for a lesbian thrill yet surely the time has come for women to have access to this technology we deserve a revolution too,2011-12,grindr smartphone app allows men find dating socialising friendship walk pub phone literally

the death of mary russell from a bleed to the brain after an alleged assault by her yearold husband albert has highlighted the fact that domestic violence among older couples is far more common than is generally thought their age often means police social care and health professionals are not as aware of the problem as they should be the abuse whether physical or psychological is often very longterm perhaps throughout a year marriage the abuser can often present as very frail if the woman has a disability or is in failing health it can add to her vulnerability said mary mason director of solace womens aid a london domestic violence service that has equality and human rights commission funding to develop a project for older women many people have a stereotype in their head of a woman who experiences domestic or sexual violence she said older women often tell us that they dont think they will be believed when they go to agencies for help the abuse they experience is often so normalised that its hard to think about leaving women in this age group may be reluctant to think about moving into a refuge to be safe but once there they can receive very specific support to help them find safety begin their recovery and achieve independence she described a couple of cases her service has worked with one involved a yearold woman married to a man of who had inflicted physical and emotional abuse on her for years police were called to their home in may after he hit her with his walking stick he was not charged with any offence and remains in the marital home she is currently living with her daughter solace is helping the woman to explore divorce proceedings and is trying to get the husband into sheltered accommodation so his wife can move back into the marital home another solace case concerns a yearold woman who has suffered physical and psychological abuse from her husband for years both have moderate learning disabilities live in a nursing home and want to remain together a solace worker is monitoring the situation and advising on the best way to keep the woman safe bridget penhale reader in mental health of older people at the university of east anglia is one of the few people studying this hidden area she is working on a new eufunded sixcountry project examining the prevalence of domestic violence among older people very few of these cases go to court because of the age of those involved so we are looking at police files to see how many callouts police have responded to involving older people and domestic violence penhale said we are picking up on a lot of cases of assault and serious assaults on older women by their partners it may be the case that the man has cognitive impairment the police investigate and the cps say its not worth prosecuting we want to look at the police arresting perpetrators as part of their response to this problem as a society we have become much more aware and attuned to the fact that violence affects younger women in their relationships but the situation as it relates to older women is nowhere near as recognised older women dont know where to go to get help services specifically for them are few and far between penhale hopes that a europeanwide awareness raising campaign will be launched to improve understanding of and responses to the problem she is working with the police and criminal justice agencies to develop a training module for officers we hope to pilot this with at least one force during next summer so that it can then be finetuned and made ready for further dissemination theresa i got married at the age of and right from the start there were little hints of what was to come from my husband i was put down all the time and made to feel worthless and inferior at first i tried to put everything he did to me to the back of my mind in the kind of society i was living in i wasnt allowed to acknowledge these things and didnt talk to anyone about what was happening to me over a period of years the verbal and psychological abuse i suffered from my husband completely eroded my confidence i wanted to go to college to pick up my studies but my husband told me i wasnt capable of doing this i believed him he told me that my job was to look after the house and garden and to care for our daughter what started as psychological violence escalated into physical violence after my daughter was born my husband used to hold me against the wall by my throat and twist my arm i didnt want to acknowledge that this was violence after my daughter grew up and left home my husband became more physically violent towards me although hitting me and bashing me against the wall rarely left marks that i could complain about to anyone even if id wanted to i put up with this for years and eventually walked out at the age of and sought help when i walked out i didnt know who i was i genuinely believed what my husband kept telling me that i was worthless and useless and wouldnt be able to cope with life without him i left my home and my job and came to london with nothing i spent months in a refuge and gradually regained my selfesteem i learnt to cope

as we begin to gather evidence for the commission on womens safety which shadow home secretary yvette cooper has asked me to chair with the help of mps kate green and stella creasy the government has started a consultation too it is about whether to widen the definition of domestic violence however it raises this at exactly the same time as it is legislating to narrow the definition of domestic violence in the legal aid bill the government is publicly contradicting itself on a topic of great concern for womens safety which it seems it does not understand this follows a number of other policies and plans which have similarly suggested that this almost totally male government has little awareness of how its proposals affect womens lives it is now well known that its cuts are hitting womens purses harder than mens wallets but there is the further worrying possibility that its policies are now impacting womens safety too first the government attempted to give anonymity to rape defendants years after the heilbron review rejected it and at a time when the real problem is that the justice system doesnt give enough victims the confidence they need to prosecute then secretary of state for justice kenneth clarke suggested that real rape was as an attack by a stranger when of cases today are by partners expartners or acquaintances he may have thought that his plan to give sentence discounts for early guilty pleas was helpful to rape complainants afraid to go to court but the conviction rate at the start of a case is meaning men have no need to plead guilty to avoid the risk of a worse sentence at that stage while the prospect of halving sentences which are already short insulted rape survivors victims of domestic violence were to be exceptions to the abolition of family law legal aid however the legislation not only narrows the definition but the evidence required to bring someone inside the definition is so tight that up to of those who currently get legal help are likely to be excluded when parliament debated this the ministers preoccupation was with false claims of domestic abuse to get legal aid not with safeguarding the vulnerable the government also seems oblivious that a consequence of taking legal aid from all family law is that violent men will have to manage their own cases at court getting a statesponsored opportunity to abuse their victims further by crossexamining them face to face there are not only concerns about direct violence out of councils asked by the telegraph are limiting street lighting or considering doing so and there are transport cuts and unstaffed trains all of these changes too seem to have been mooted without regard to their impact on women for instance on nurses going home from late shifts there are also worries about the future has anyone in government considered who will commission domestic abuse support services when primary care trusts are abolished what priority will the coalition expect elected police commissioners to give to gender crime there are three welcome new governmentfunded rape crisis centres but in the same geographical areas women tell us that domestic violence coordinators are disappearing as women and men alike lose work and family incomes are squeezed will links between economic stress and domestic violence mean more women are victimised when there are fewer resources to help them get away currently two women a week are killed by violent partners many womens organisations are worried the womens institute has produced a seminal paper setting out the danger to women from the wholesale legal aid cuts the eavespoppy project has described young women escaping abuse who through cuts in homelessness provision cant find anywhere to stay and have to sleep in the safest park false economy and voluntary sector cuts have done initial work on the cumulative impact of these changes for women but the overall picture is hard to grasp and we need much more evidence our commission is holding its first meeting today scoping out the key current issues on womens safety with the leading national womens sector groups in the new year we will go nationwide to gather evidence and find out whether current concerns are justified and whether the reality is better or worse we will be unequivocally clear about what we find and are well aware that we are working in the context of economic pressures and a dearth of public funds we will be looking for fresh ideas and investigating what legislative measures might safeguard women in the future we will

has nadine dorries had a good year or a bad even she seems not to be sure how to answer this although her amendment to the health bill on abortion was defeated in the commons in september she is willing to bet that this time next year a regulatory framework will have been introduced requiring all abortion providers to offer counselling to any woman who presents with an emergency pregnancy a prospect she regards as fantastic even if she is disconcertingly vague when it comes to the fine print will this framework pass into law and if it doesnt how will it be implemented i dont know she says with a dismissive flick of her head then again these are strange times to be a rebellious tory woman in september david cameron reduced his backbenchers to hysteria when he noted aloud that he knew dorries was extremely frustrated cameron soon apologised but it is clear that his victim is still smarting did she feel his text message was insincere she pulls a face youll have to make your own mind up about that something about dorries the mp for mid bedfordshire attracts a special kind of heat yes the issues around abortion are guaranteed to raise blood pressure dorries knew this perfectly well when she attempted to have abortion providers such as marie stopes stripped of their role in counselling women she wanted socalled independent organisations to do the job instead a change prochoice campaigners feared would provide openings for counsellors linked to antiabortion groups but even so she was unprepared for what followed some of the reporting my position was grossly misrepresented gave ammunition to the nutters out there she says it was horrific i had death threats one person described how my skin would peel off my body as i was trapped in a locked burning car so what is it about her that gets people so worked up why do some men andrew neil joked about being madder than a box of nadine dorrieses feel able to laugh at her in so unbridled a fashion she thinks its simple sexism though she is loth to spell this out you can say that but if i do im just seen as moaning playing the woman card again look there are two lots of mps here there are those who are incredibly loyal and do whatever the leadership wants because they want careers for women mps in that group things are especially good because cameron wants more women then there are those who are more independently minded like me i disagree with cameron on many things im here for my constituents not to do what the party wants if youre that kind of mp and a woman you feel the wrath times more than if you were a man you get hatred what will the new year bring dorries is convinced that the coalition of which she is emphatically not a fan is not long for this world next year is going to be very difficult the lib dems are going to hit a brick wall some time soon i think they will use the issue of europe as an exit from the coalition probably towards the end of that will get them out before the boundary commission review which will see their party annihilated do turkeys vote for christmas no they dont as for the commons she cant see things improving much for its as she sees it persecuted and hardpressed members thanks to the expenses scandal its a place of monks and millionaires i was with an mp the other day and his wife rang him she was at the supermarket checkout and her debit card had been refused they had no money in their account he was just distraught and all because hes too scared to claim travel expenses scared of what the local paper will write if he does people are starving poor things does she find the commons lonely dorries a divorced mother of three adult daughters is single again having separated after just six months from john butler the estranged husband of an old friend rachael butler accused dorries of wrecking her marriage i suppose it is lonely yes another single mp said to me we dont make the last call do we he was talking about the moment when every night at after the last vote everyone picks up their mobile and phones home isnt meeting someone new a possibility no my friend is internet dating and having a ball but theres no way i could do it imagine meeting nadine dorries on the internet she smiles mournfully im quite resigned as a result of my job to being alone for the rest of my life thats just how its going to be and

the governments consultation on redefining domestic violence is disingenuous given its economic policies and the policing they are promoting proposals to include coercive control within the definition of domestic violence are unlikely to improve the situation of women and girls who need reliable law enforcement it is not legislation but firm unbiased police response that is urgently required will charges of coercive control be taken seriously when clear repeated assaults and threats to life are not does the government want police to pass judgment on what constitutes emotional violence will this not be used to blur imperatives for police intervention proposals about extending protection to unders would help but we have to remember that young people see a system that supports neither them nor their mothers the guardians extensive investigation of the riots revealed widespread fury at the police while girls are less likely to be victims of stopandsearch than male counterparts they are angry at the treatment faced by brothers and boyfriends especially if theyre not white and the disrespect meted out to their distressed mothers by officers redefining domestic violence to give police greater power of judgment in young womens personal lives will hardly restore trust what would help is redefining police and court priorities so that crimes against the person are dealt with more harshly than crimes against property two women are murdered every week by partners or expartners police repeatedly ignore reports of domestic violence and death threats the murder of christine chambers in essex earlier this year is not a oneoff and officers who didnt protect victims of domestic murder or rape are usually not disciplined let alone sacked in of rape cases reported to the metropolitan police were domestic yet they are rarely prosecuted in this context instead each rape threat or assault is considered in isolation so that the extent of the violence never emerges and the perpetrator if prosecuted at all is more likely to be acquitted the sixmonth time limit on pursuing a charge of criminal assault is another obstacle to conviction it denies women enough time to leave ensure they and their children are safe and only then pursue justice not against an isolated incident but the full spectrum of crimes committed against them women are not quick to report partners on average a woman is assaulted times before she first calls the police the british crime survey suggests that only of sexual assaults and of incidents of partner abuse are reported why so few because they cannot rely on the police to believe them protect them or prosecute their attacker officers are quick to accept mens claim that the woman provoked them or attacked them first centuries of social acceptance of violence have undermined womens confidence and mothers may be anxious to keep a roof over childrens heads and may be justifiably worried about losing custody to violent fathers or to social services if they leave while violence affects women of every class the poorer we are the fewer resources we have to escape it and recent government policies reinforce barriers to escape first the cuts in jobs and services are hitting women hardest second such policies as the welfare reform bill now in the lords take away what little protection we had the social fund a lifeline for women fleeing violence by providing for emergency expenses for a new home is being abolished traumatised women are forced into jobseeking the government has refused to extend the exemption period necessary for recovery beyond three months similarly the cap on housing benefit will make it harder for women to leave violent partners moreover cuts to refuges legal aid citizens advice and other community support remove the expert help women need to get any legal protection at all instead the government is putting into a fund for male victims of domestic violence many are appalled at the sustained attack by government on womens waged employment and benefits and services and say so but an obvious connection which every woman instinctively feels goes unmentioned when were poorer were more vulnerable sexually to partners employers officials does the government know their policies make women more sexually available domestic violence the most common violent crime should be a priority for

weve chosen our top women of but who is no every list of this type elicits the same question and gets the same answer its impossible to choose some of these women especially those living in egypt saudi arabia and the democratic republic of the congo have faced grave personal danger while others simply inspire millions of other women and girls and we know from your comments elsewhere that you sense this dichotomy as keenly as we do some of you also distrust any singlesex list my view on this is that when mixedgender lists start reflecting womens representation in society roughly then lists that focus on the forgotten half holding up the sky can be dropped anyway it seemed the right time to draw up a representative list of some of the great achievements or campaigns of a year in which womens rights have moved up the agenda around the world whether as a focus of the arab spring or at the heart of complaints from oppressive regimes or as political leaders even then we cheated and counted three women as one but after waiting so long for a woman to win the nobel peace prize only in its year history we got three at once this year in choosing the women who brought peace to the formerly wartorn liberia and marched against the use of rape and child soldiers in its bitter civil war and the youngest ever peace prize winner who did so much to fight for human rights in yemen we recognise the importance of their award for all women you may feel differently however should we pick one of these women or someone else entirely,2011-12,weve chosen top woman every list type elicits question get answer impossible choose woman especially living egypt saudi arabia democratic republic congo faced grave personal danger others simply inspire million woman girl know comment elsewhere sense dichotomy keenly also distrust singlesex list view mixedgender list start reflecting womens representation society roughly list focus forgotten half holding sky dropped anyway seemed right time draw representative list great achievement campaign year womens right moved agenda around world whether focus arab spring heart complaint oppressive regime political leader even cheated counted three woman one waiting long woman win nobel peace prize year history got three year choosing woman brought peace formerly wartorn liberia marched use rape child soldier bitter civil war youngest ever peace prize winner much fight human right yemen recognise importance award woman may feel differently however pick one woman someone else entirely,"['weve', 'chosen', 'top', 'woman', 'every', 'list', 'type', 'elicits', 'question', 'get', 'answer', 'impossible', 'choose', 'woman', 'especially', 'living', 'egypt', 'saudi', 'arabia', 'democratic', 'republic', 'congo', 'faced', 'grave', 'personal', 'danger', 'others', 'simply', 'inspire', 'million', 'woman', 'girl', 'know', 'comment', 'elsewhere', 'sense', 'dichotomy', 'keenly', 'also', 'distrust', 'singlesex', 'list', 'view', 'mixedgender', 'list', 'start', 'reflecting', 'womens', 'representation', 'society', 'roughly', 'list', 'focus', 'forgotten', 'half', 'holding', 'sky', 'dropped', 'anyway', 'seemed', 'right', 'time', 'draw', 'representative', 'list', 'great', 'achievement', 'campaign', 'year', 'womens', 'right', 'moved', 'agenda', 'around', 'world', 'whether', 'focus', 'arab', 'spring', 'heart', 'complaint', 'oppressive', 'regime', 'political', 'leader', 'even', 'cheated', 'counted', 'three', 'woman', 'one', 'waiting', 'long', 'woman', 'win', 'nobel', 'peace', 'prize', 'year', 'history', 'got', 'three', 'year', 'choosing', 'woman', 'brought', 'peace', 'formerly', 'wartorn', 'liberia', 'marched', 'use', 'rape', 'child', 'soldier', 'bitter', 'civil', 'war', 'youngest', 'ever', 'peace', 'prize', 'winner', 'much', 'fight', 'human', 'right', 'yemen', 'recognise', 'importance', 'award', 'woman', 'may', 'feel', 'differently', 'however', 'pick', 'one', 'woman', 'someone', 'else', 'entirely']",14
unmarried couples who have lived together for five years or more should be able to inherit from each other without writing a will the law commission has recommended its recommendations which are contained in the inheritance cohabitants bill state that this entitlement should be applied after two years of cohabiting if a couple has a child providing the child was living with the couple when one parent died it also states that qualifying cohabitants should have the same entitlement under the intestacy rules as a spouse however if the deceased has a husband or wife from a fossil marriage where a couple are living apart but have never divorced the surviving cohabitant has no entitlement to any of the estate between a half and twothirds of adults in england and wales have not made a will and over the most recent fiveyear period for which figures are available more than applications were made for a grant to administer intestate estates the law commission says the problem will be even worse as more than half of estates are administered without a formal grant although million people live in cohabiting families representing of all families the law commission says cohabitants are among the people least likely to have a will under the current intestacy laws property is passed on to family members with those closest in blood relationship receiving the bulk and more distant relatives only benefitting if there are no more immediate relatives to take the property if there are children the surviving spouse will receive the personal possessions a legacy of and a life interest in half of everything that is left the children receive the other half of the residue in equal shares where the deceased has no children the surviving spouse gets a statutory legacy of and half the residue the other half will pass to the remaining relatives with parents coming first in order of priority followed by brothers and sisters and then their children unmarried partners are currently entitled to nothing but can apply through court for family provision the court makes awards that reflect the lifestyle of the cohabitant with his or her deceased partner and which provides a measure of longterm security gareth curtis an associate in the private client team of solicitors dwf welcomed the recommendations as an improvement on the current rules on intestacy but said the two and fiveyear cut off points would be galling for those who died just before conclusion of those time periods he said the best way to deal with this uncertainty was still to write a will its more definitive and respects the rights of the individual concerned he added that family provision rights already protect those who are dependent quite adequately the majority of my case work deals with cohabiting people who have split up in my view the government should deal with rights after separation rather than this where theres not a big problem the bill is part of a major review of inheritance law which includes measures to make sure that where a couple is married or in a civil partnership assets pass on to the surviving spouse in all cases where there are no children or other descendants and to protect children from the risk of losing an inheritance from a deceased parent if they are then adopted,2011-12,unmarried couple lived together five year able inherit without writing law

my first experience with womenonly bank branches was in saudi arabia in keeping with the spirit of gender segregation major highstreet banks opened womenonly branches in the s that were staffed by and catered only to female customers it was often a frustrating experience and the more complicated the transaction the more likely it was that i would end up in the adjoining mens branch heaping embarrassment on the male clients and staff who rudely and speedily saw to my needs so that i would vacate the premises as soon as possible as i was a single woman with no male guardian there was no way i could delegate a man to conduct simple financial transactions and most women who made regular use of the banks services were in the same position at the time products and services were limited these very ornate branches mostly catered for cash withdrawals that exceeded atm limits it was all rather informal and bordered on the unprofessional but to some women who had a guardian and independent incomes it was a welcome way of managing their own financial affairs without having them linked inextricably to their fathers or husbands this obviously sounds backward and archaic but it is not only arab and muslim countries that are separating male and female banking services as far back as the s banks in the west have experimented with womens branches in the national commercial bank opened a womens branch in scotland where it would take more than a ravishing smile to get an overdraft and the walls were panelled in a willow shade toning delightfully with a seaweed green carpet womens branches in the middle east are born out of practical necessity but more recently banks all over the world are catering specifically for women such branches have opened in east africa the indian subcontinent mexico italy and bulgaria and morgan stanley and abn amro has launched an investment fund run by and for women in conservative societies this is a welcome move standard chartered in india opened a branch where even the security officers were female as their clients expressed a preference for a noninhibiting environment this is not to suggest that women are gentle creatures that cannot walk into a malestaffed bank without swooning in vapours of intimidation as someone who has been on the receiving end of the gruff misogyny and clumsy flirtation of male bank employees in the middle east i would be much more comfortable dealing with competent women it is also a welcome move in developing economies such as kenya where one local bank was given a cash injection by the undp to finance women entrepreneurs and promote their financial literacy it does appear however that the new womens branches opening up in europe are more of a marketing ploy than a response to a genuine need tsvetanka mincheva deputy head of retail banking at unicredit bulbank is quoted as saying that their new women branch has a more modern atmosphere using purple and violet as its flagship colours instead of the traditional red and white and providing a more comfortable and convenient atmosphere for women to bank in the donna product range is billed as one that caters for the needs of the modern woman one of those needs a consumer loan mincheva adds can be used to finance plastic surgery as opposed to identifying real needs or different patterns of financial behaviour this breed of womenonly banking is merely pardon the pun cosmetic hoping to attract customers through branding and shallow patronising product offers my old twowoman staffed branch in riyadh probably provides a more vital service than this modern alternative i have heard various complaints from married women in the west that their banks tend to assume that their male partners are in charge and tend not to take them too seriously and there are tales of single women of means who are met with raised eyebrows as they buy properties or make investments without a male partner but i doubt this reflects enough systemic bias towards men to set up independent branches for women the question should be do women have profoundly differing financial needs that high street banks are structurally incapable of addressing in developed economies probably not it is just a matter of pushing for reforming oldfashioned attitudes and an expansion of products available to women one bank in mexico is offering a health insurance product that targets diseases more common in women such as cervical cancer and maternity leave moratoria on repayment on loans are standard in the middle east such moves would do much more to attract female clients to banks than changing the colour of the carpets this article was commissioned after a suggestion by shakercoola if theres a subject youd like to see covered on comment

so this year women have marched as sluts and fannies you know i dont think were sending out the right message while i entirely agree with the principles behind these marches they seem to be reducing women to the same kind of stereotypes were fighting against that were defined by our vaginas we seem to have compromised a lot in a race to get headlines to get trending on twitter and to get our witty placards on newspaper slideshows this weekends muff march was about the very real issue of cosmetic genital surgery some women are feeling so ashamed of their nether regions that theyre willing to take a knife to it lady gardens are not just undergoing topiary theyre having invasive relandscaping labiaplasty cutting off bits of the labia vaginal tightening and hymen reconstruction are all on the increase and while women importantly are consenting to these procedures the context in which theyre doing so is the problem a context of ladybits of shame women and girls have to live with accusations of smelling like fish smelling during our periods having vaginas that are too slack having labia that is not neat enough growing too much hair as though its a choice or not decorating a minge like a christmas tree with some ghastly vajazzle theyre reacting to these accusations with razors wax and a surgeons scalpel there has been far more activism against designer vaginas in the us where the phenomenon has been more prevalent for longer but there is an interesting difference in approach us activism is far more concerned about the risk of such untested unregulated and unnecessary procedures to womens health the muff march in london became undeniably and inevitably about porn that will certainly help it get press coverage for a couple of days and get the commentators apoplectic but it will also alienate a lot of women who do not believe all their personal choices about their body are pornbased that bush trimming is treachery or who certainly dont want the focus of womens rights to be muffcentric making the march about porn obscures the very real health risks of this surgery experimental procedures carried out to demand that surgeons arent trained to do and more widely the quack remedies for nonexistent sexual problems peddled by immoral fluff pieces in newspapers and magazines as dr petra boynton sex researcher and educator commented the focus of the muff march on porn is i think limiting while porn has undoubtedly had an impact on how we view our bodies i dont think it is accurate to simply see it as the main factor driving women to have cosmetic genital surgery or remove their pubic hair in fact id say the mainstream media has a far greater role to play here but is not held accountable dont get me wrong im a massive muff fan happily in my experience many men agree with louis de bernires theres nothing better than to burrow and disappear into a good abundant honest muff but i dont see how this protest addresses the very real issues of the health risk of this surgery and other quack medicines being touted in the press to men and women about their arbitrarilydefined sexual dysfunction it doesnt make the link to all the penis enlargement viagra sale emails currently pounding my spam folder nor the wider medicalisation of sex it draws parallels to female genital mutilation which is monumentally insensitive to the women and girls living with that across the world these are women who would not be donning a tinselled merkin in the centre of london its remarkable that all women have to do to make a political statement it seems is not shave so much is done to make us feel ashamed about our fulsome beavers that a fullon muff is seen as courageous brave or even don king in a leglock organising a march with women parading as quims and condemning pornography is ironically sexy for the media as proven by the large number of photographers at saturdays march but being promuff doesnt mean i feel the need to shove my growler in your face its great that people are getting off their laptops and doing something to change the world but that has to be followed by logical and sensible discussion of the core issues pleasing the media to get a picture of a bunch of stunts is not enough,2011-12,year woman marched slut fanny know dont think sending right message entirely agree principle behind march seem reducing woman kind stereotype

following your article why is british public life dominated by men g december readers might be interested in my analysis of the choice of christmas books in the guardian published the previous week books were chosen by men and nine women the gender imbalance in those asked to choose books might not have mattered if men and women were similar in their choice of books but they were not among the books the women chose half were by men and half by women among the books the men chose threequarters were by men and only onequarter by women the result was that the guardian recommended books by women but books by men gender bias is often unnoticed i suspect most readers will not have seen that twice as many books by men were recommended compared with books by women this is just one example of the way in which womens contribution to culture is devalued and made invisible jan pahl canterbury kent,2011-12,following article british public life dominated men g december reader might interested analysis choice christmas book guardian published previous week book chosen men nine woman gender imbalance asked choose book might mattered men woman similar choice book among book woman chose half men half woman among book men chose threequarters men onequarter woman result wa guardian recommended book woman book men gender bias often unnoticed suspect reader seen twice many book men recommended compared book woman one example way womens contribution culture devalued made invisible jan pahl canterbury kent,"['following', 'article', 'british', 'public', 'life', 'dominated', 'men', 'g', 'december', 'reader', 'might', 'interested', 'analysis', 'choice', 'christmas', 'book', 'guardian', 'published', 'previous', 'week', 'book', 'chosen', 'men', 'nine', 'woman', 'gender', 'imbalance', 'asked', 'choose', 'book', 'might', 'mattered', 'men', 'woman', 'similar', 'choice', 'book', 'among', 'book', 'woman', 'chose', 'half', 'men', 'half', 'woman', 'among', 'book', 'men', 'chose', 'threequarters', 'men', 'onequarter', 'woman', 'result', 'wa', 'guardian', 'recommended', 'book', 'woman', 'book', 'men', 'gender', 'bias', 'often', 'unnoticed', 'suspect', 'reader', 'seen', 'twice', 'many', 'book', 'men', 'recommended', 'compared', 'book', 'woman', 'one', 'example', 'way', 'womens', 'contribution', 'culture', 'devalued', 'made', 'invisible', 'jan', 'pahl', 'canterbury', 'kent']",14

it is hard to imagine today in an era in which female police officers hold some of the most important roles in the service the hurdles that had to be overcome by shirley becke the first woman to reach the most senior of ranks of the police becke who has died aged was a pioneer at a time when female officers were limited to minor and peripheral roles born shirley jennings in chiswick west london she was the daughter of a gas engineer and was also a pioneer in her fathers trade after attending ealing grammar school and westminster polytechnic she became the first woman to qualify as a higher grade gas engineer and as a young woman worked for the gas light and coke company which later became north thames gas during the second world war with many of the younger male police officers on active service in the armed forces she applied to join the metropolitan police imagining that she would probably remain there only for the duration of the conflict she joined the force in realising that she enjoyed the work she stayed on and in the immediate postwar years worked in the cid in one of the mets most challenging areas west end central like many of the female officers in that era she was assigned to investigate the burgeoning vice trade in soho she was promoted to the rank of sergeant in to inspector in and to superintendent in it was while involved in a fraud investigation in the west end that she met a chartered accountant justice becke whom she married in he later became a vicar in surrey becke took over the womens police branch at the met known as a until it was dissolved in in anticipation of equal pay legislation from all female officers were subsumed into the main body of the force although this did not mean that they were granted equal acceptance women in the police had long fought sometimes bitter battles for equality the founders of the womens service in were a militant suffragette nina boyle and an antiwhiteslavery campaigner margaret damer dawson and the women recruited had initially to be spinsters or widows and were obliged to leave the service if they married or had children becke was to win her own place in the history of female officers arguing throughout her career for greater representation of women she was the driving force behind advertising campaigns aimed at recruiting women in the s in the wake of the redesign of the uniform in by the royal fashion designer norman hartnell previously recruitment ads were aimed predominantly at men by she had reached the rank of commander which entitled her to become the first female member of the association of chief police officers acpo which represents the most senior officers it is an indication of how much has changed since then that there are now dozens of women at similar levels in the uk and earlier this year one of them sara thornton the thames valley chief constable was a contender for the post of metropolitan police commissioner cressida dick the assistant commissioner and sue akers who is leading the investigation into phone hacking are further examples of how far women have advanced as part of the force inspectorate from until her retirement the following year becke was involved in attempting to ensure fair representation for female officers not always the easiest of tasks in what was still a very macho culture even after her retirement becke remained highly regarded within the service her personal story is an inspiration making it clear women could do the same role as men within the service said the current president of acpo sir hugh orde her determination most certainly contributed to the more inclusive police service we see today becke received the queens police medal in and was made an obe in she worked after her retirement in the womens royal voluntary service and lived in chichester west sussex nearly a quarter of metropolitan police officers are now women and the fictional detective jane tennison played by helen mirren in itvs prime suspect and based on a reallife flying squad detective jackie malton is part of the national landscape malton joined the police just as becke was leaving and says that for female officers she was a huge inspiration she is still very much revered and she achieved everything with great grace and dignity which i found admirable becke was predeceased by her husband shirley cameron becke

here come the girls ok sorry its just me unfortunately a woman with a byline who often complains about the male domination of public life walking the walk well hobbling along lets not be hypocritical i have a fairsized column after all which is more than most men but still when i sit watching have i got news for you i hate to hear my youngest pipe up look mum they have got a woman leader this week this matters because i thought things would change and i was relying on a younger generation to step up to the plate kira cochranes impressive analysis in g on monday shows this simply has not happened on average only of mps peers and the cabinet are women in business it is actually worse this isnt simply sexism i think it is a little more complicated than that as i work in newspapers i am often asked to be a tv panellist or guest i wont lie about it so here is some honesty that may end my tv career i am good only when i care about the subject i have been asked to talk about otherwise it merely feels like rentagob recently i was asked if i would like to take mdma the active ingredient in ecstasy in a live experiment on tv supervised by scientists not knowing if this was some chris morristype spoof i simply replied that this was an interesting idea and asked my kids what they thought they were not keen i was also worried that the producers were not going to give me enough to do much nor did i want the results of empathy tests and my brain scans broadcast to the nation things are quite bad enough as they are i have also been asked several times to go on serious shows and talk about the leveson inquiry with the likes of hugh grant and steve coogan these guys are confident performers its what they do and i am not so i have declined those invitations too then a couple of weeks ago i turned down a sunday programme because they called me on a thursday and needed me in belfast on a saturday which meant getting childcare yes life trumps telly yesterday though i did a radio interview organised with proper notice in my own home listeners may not like what i say but they will not go on twitter and claim that my basic problem is that i need or cant get sex well only a few will this after all is the intellectual contribution made about most women in public life radio is better for me than television i used to enjoy doing start the week with melvyn bragg though i did once hear a producer complain about polytechnic accents so it is not just sexism race figures but class remains a huge factor and by class i mean not just confidence but that genetic ability to bullshit women if i have to generalise are very good at faking some things but not always the things that matter we want to be liked and are fearful of being judged on our looks there is a freedom in ageing trust me but the media needs fresh meat why though are we so afraid of being unlovable and ignorant when every day men ooze these qualities in serious discussions when i was editing i would often ask women who i knew had expertise to write for me but they would need so much encouragement that often yes i would use a less good man simply to meet a deadline a man who was prepared to fake it we say no when we should say yes because we dont feel worth it we dont feel we can cover every base this is a problem of political discourse you cant go on question time and say i am not really sure about the euro even though no one is really sure about the euro or actually nhs funding is not my area when you are up against politicians who have had teams briefing them your job as i was told aeons ago when booked to appear on question time is to represent the average mum which i screwed up badly by asking that myra hindley be released and all drugs be legalised while sitting next to david trimble so the last time question time called at the last minute of course i joked i would only go on dressed as a giant poppy as the bbc was in full poppy mode really though i thought why put myself through a popularity contest that i never chose to enter i guess i am not in the lingo hungry enough indeed i feel sick that we are still having the are women funny discussion political and comedy programmes consist mostly of dots dicks on tables pointscoring currently there are lots of men shouting at each other about the economy presided over by jeremy paxman in wristslitting despair it is now only a remote possibility that i will ever again troop off to some dire tv studio for a glass of cheap white wine while some poor makeup person tries to brighten me up for i wont be as clever and lovely and poised as emily maitlis pictured or kirsty wark or kirsty young because that is not my job i simply want to see the younger versions of them coming through so being past caring means i can say no and not do my duty for the sisterhood because at pm i am either in or i am out and if out there is the terrible prospect that i go on tv and do what they actually tell me be yourself which is what they think they want but trust me they dont,2011-12,come girl ok sorry unfortunately woman byline often complains male domination public life walking walk well hobbling along let hypocritical

the number of women and girls in the uk suffering violence and intimidation at the hands of their families or communities is increasing rapidly according to figures revealing the nationwide scale of honour abuse for the first time statistics obtained under the freedom of information act about such violence which can include threats abduction acid attacks beatings forced marriage mutilation and murder show that in the police force areas for which comparable data was available reports went up by in just a year the figures shared with the guardian by the iranian and kurdish womens rights organisation ikwro also reveal that a small number of forces including four in scotland are still not collecting data on how often such violence occurs the police forces that gave ikwro figures recorded incidents in ikwro estimates that another crimes in which police were involved were committed in the force areas that did not provide data but this is likely to be only the tip of the iceberg campaigners say as so many incidents go unreported because of victims fears of recriminations jasvinder sanghera of victim support group karma nirvana said the real figure could be four times as high among the forces that gave figures for and the number of incidents rose from to in london reported incidents rose from to in greater manchester from to ikwros campaigns officer fionnuala ni mhurchu said the increase was probably due partly to better police awareness and to more victims coming forward after coverage of highprofile prosecutions but that violence itself was also increasing as young people increasingly refused to bow to their families demands theyre resisting abuses of their human rights such as forced marriage more and more she said and as a result theyre being subjected to this kind of violence we hear from the community that this violence is on the increase these figures are important because they demonstrate this is not a minor problem it is a serious issue affecting thousands of people a year many of whom will suffer high levels of abuse before they seek help we want the government to develop a national strategy on honourbased violence that covers not just policing but also issues such as education and community cohesion this is the first time uk figures have been collated for socalled honourbased violence defined as crimes planned and carried out by a family or community in order to defend their perceived honour previously a figure of honour killings a year has been cited although it is unclear where the number comes from in banaz mahmod a yearold kurd was strangled on the orders of her father and uncle because they disapproved of her boyfriend she had repeatedly told police her family were trying to kill her the case led the association of chief police officers acpo to publish a new strategy in which highlighted the need to gauge the scale of the problem to improve police work and recommended that all english and welsh forces introduce a mechanism to record the number of reports there is no national guidance in scotland ikwro said it was concerned that some forces were still not collecting the data in a consistent format and called on acpo and acpo scotland to help ensure this was done and release statistics regularly sanghera said complete data was crucial to prove the scale of the problem adding that she feared momentum had been lost in recent years commander mak chishty of acpo insisted this was not the case adding that the police national database which is being phased in would provide collated figures we have reviewed every force with a questionnaire and the strategy has been completed he said were now in consultation on a new strategy all frontline staff have received awareness training and every force has a champion on honourbased abuse im confident that any victim who comes to us will receive the help they need mayas story when i was my mum came into my room one day and said i had to get married to my

sexualisation has become a muchdebated issue in recent years and a noticeable feature is the assumption that feminists who oppose sexual objectification are generating a moral panic ever since sociologist stanley cohen introduced the term in it has been used as a shorthand way of critiquing conservatives for inventing another problem in order to demonise a group that challenges traditional moral standards so apparently feminists are now the conservatives fomenting unnecessary panic about the proliferation of sexualised images while the corporatecontrolled media industry that mass produces these images is the progressive force for change being unfairly demonised what a strange turn of events to suggest feminists who oppose the pornification of society are stirring up a moral panic is to confuse a politically progressive movement with rightwing attempts to police sexual behaviour we can of course identify just such a conservative strand in current debates in britain interventions of the coalition government include calls for girls to be given lessons in how to practise abstinence and attacks on abortion rights but feminists who organise against pornification are not arguing that sexualised images of women cause moral decay rather that they perpetuate myths of womens unconditional sexual availability and object status and thus undermine womens rights to sexual autonomy physical safety and economic and social equality the harm done to women is not a moral harm but a political one and any analysis must be grounded in a critique of the corporate control of our visual landscape the left has a long history of fighting capitalist ownership of the media from karl marx to antonio gramsci to noam chomsky leftist thinkers have understood the corporate media to be the propaganda machine for capitalist ideas and values by mainstreaming the ideologies of the elite corporatecontrolled media shapes our identities as workers and consumers selling an image of success and happiness tied to the consumption of products that generate enormous wealth for the elite class alternative views are at best marginalised and at worst ridiculed no one in progressive circles would suggest for a moment that criticism of the corporate media is a moral panic chomsky has never as far as we know been called a moral entrepreneur yet those of us who organise against the corporations that churn out sexist imagery are regularly dismissed as stirring moral panic the industryengineered image of femininity has now become the dominant one in western society crowding out alternative ways of being female the clothes cosmetics diets gym membership trips to the hair salon the waxing salon and the nail salon add up to a lot of money even in these dark economic times when women are experiencing the most severe financial hardship the uk beauty business is booming womens selfloathing is big business and supports a global capitalist system that ironically depends heavily on the exploitation of womens labour in developing countries adding insult to injury many of these underpaid women are spending a significant proportion of their wages on skinwhitening products that promise social mobility out of the sweatshops in the west cosmetic surgery is increasingly normalised last year in the uk almost women underwent breast augmentation surgery and the number of labiaplasties has almost tripled in five years one plastic surgeon helpfully explains on his website that labiaplasty can sculpture the elongated or unequal labial sic minora small inner lips according to ones specification with laser reduction labiaplasty we can accomplish the desires of the woman if this is not evidence of living in a sexualised culture what is the emotional cost of conforming to hypersexualisation is enormous for girls and young women who are in the process of forming their gender and sexual identities we construct our identities through complex processes of interaction with the culture around us but today images of hypersexualisation dominate where is a girl to go if she decides beyonc miley cyrus lady gaga rihanna or britney spears arent for her an american psychological association study on girls sexualisation found that it has negative effects in a variety of domains including cognitive functioning physical and mental health sexuality and attitudes and beliefs some of these effects include risky sexual behaviour higher rates of eating disorders depression and low selfesteem and reduced academic performance of course there are girls who resist but there are real social penalties to be paid by those who do not conform to acceptable feminine appearance this weekend feminist campaigners are hosting a conference on the pornification of culture in the buildup mass protests were held outside the london playboy club and miss world beauty contest to highlight the relationship between corporate interests and the objectification of women
