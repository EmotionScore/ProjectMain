last week i made a throwaway comment about the amount of screen time my son is currently enjoying it was a tongueincheek reference because to be honest i dont really have many qualms about screen time but since then ive had conversations with several parents who really do not least because newspapers blogs and extended family members crucially never currently looking after toddlers themselves have made them feel guilty about the fact their child is spending more time with screens right now it made me angry to hear the same tedious patterns of shame and judgment wielded against parents who are just trying to get by as best they can aside from how much this puritanical scolding bothers me in principle i also call shenanigans on its actual claims the longitudinal effects of screen use are still unknown and unlikely to be known by the same people who peddle tabloidfriendly memes in which studies show entirely dubious conjecture articles like men think about muesli times a day which are always funded by dark money from the uk muesli advocacy council when i was growing up the papers assured my parents that video games were evil this was mainly due to jealousy since my parents generation grew up at a time when the only excitement in their lives was getting a glimpse at the pond in the blue peter garden or playing that one game were you push a metal hoop with a stick mario and sonic it was said would turn me and all my friends into sociopaths now weve grown up and those same papers revile my generation as touchyfeely snowflakes sometimes the same amateur educationists who claim screens will turn our kids into braindead zombies also say we should be teaching children to code as soon as they can speak which raises the question of where precisely theyre going to learn computer programming if theyve already used up their allotted eight minutes of screen time for the day scrawling ones and zeros into the sand with a stick perhaps since its a bit tough to provide the time and energy necessary for nonscreen parenting right now we can agree to an armistice until things shake out you can forgive us for subjecting our children to hey duggee sesame street and that netflix cartoon about talking motorbikes which has all the educational value of a canned chicken and for my part ill stop fantasising about strapping these nags into a thcentury trebuchet and blasting them into the side of television centre with the intention of landing them in the soupy murk of the longabandoned blue peter garden pond a truce settled we can get back to dealing with the here and

a baby girl toddles down the pavement stopping only to squeeze a drop of sanitiser on to her hands and rub them carefully together except shes not stopping at handgel pumps shes pushing hopefully at garden walls street lights ventilation grilles on the side of buildings anything that catches the eye of a resourceful toddler raised in a time when washing away the virus is as natural a part of life as nap time a video of her doing it racked up millions of views on social media this week because its both hilarious and sweet shes clearly delighted with herself for being able to copy what the grownups do but its oddly poignant too a year into this pandemic there are babies now learning to walk and talk who have never known anything but life under the shadow of covid and preschoolers who can barely remember a world before it doctors children have had to learn not to touch mummy when she gets in from work until shes had a shower to wash off any last possible trace of danger thanks to popular toddler demand you can now buy masks for dolls its perfectly normal for kids to reflect whats happening around them by playing quarantine with stuffed animals but normal too for adults to wonder uncomfortably whether all this leaves a lasting mark how much will it matter in years to come that as the minister for loneliness diana barran recently put it there are toddlers being raised by shielding parents who have never had a playdate will covid babies grow up solitary creatures used to entertaining themselves or warier of the strangers they so rarely meet and interact with taking a tiny bundle out in public used to mean an endless succession of random older women cooing over the pram or strangers pulling faces to entertain a bored baby in a checkout queue but now passersby darent get close and other shoppers are hidden behind masks this week mps were presented with some early findings from a project led by the first days movement an alliance of earlyyears charities and professionals tracking the lives of undertwos growing up through a pandemic a survey of childrens service providers it commissioned found thought the babies and toddlers they worked with had been affected by higher parental stress and anxiety while had seen fearful families effectively cutting themselves off from the outside world skipping routine appointments or not wanting to leave the house nine in had observed children being played with less or being less active heartbreakingly more than a quarter said lockdown left the children they worked with more exposed to domestic conflict abuse or neglect and while cocooning through lockdown with a new baby will have been blissful for some the researchers noted that by the summer gps were experiencing a sharp rise in struggling new parents needing help while babies in betteroff families may have flourished with everyone stuck at home enjoying more of their parents time and attention than usual its a different story for those born into households on the edge parents rightly worry about the mental health of teenagers in a pandemic only too acutely aware that life is passing them by but do babies and toddlers suffer in a different way from absorbing adult fears and anxieties without ever understanding the reasons for them ministers growing willingness to listen to lobbying from new mothers both in and out of parliament has thankfully made this lockdown kinder than the first at least now in some parts of the uk you can push the pram around the park with a friend the playgrounds arent padlocked and nurseries stayed open to all comers in january when schools did not though some worry about how sustainable that is with serious outbreaks in some london childcare settings the legacy of nurseries closing in the first lockdown was some fouryearolds arriving in school last september still in nappies and unable to use cutlery now its time for a much bigger leap of imagination when lockdown lifts well need a concerted national effort both to compensate for the support underfives have missed and to understand how their strange early experiences will shape them as they grow but it needs to focus on the children at the sharp end the ones whose families have struggled most through the pandemic this catchup programme might sound uncannily like the muchmissed sure start founded by the blair government to give underfives a better start in life but a better name would be start over a way of helping tiny children leave this anxious lonely time behind them covid babies dont have to be the unlucky generation

people at risk of domestic abuse during the coronavirus lockdown will be able to seek help discreetly by giving a code word to pharmacists under a ukwide scheme launched by ministers if someone asks for ani at one of the participating pharmacies they will be given the chance to go to a private space to talk to see if they need help from police or other services such as domestic abuse helplines the name is an acronym for action needed immediately abuse charities have expressed significant concern about the impact of domestic abuse during lockdown when women children and others are denied regular contact with others pharmacies have been chosen as the outlet for the plan because they have staff trained to support people and are also classed as essential retail meaning they remain open the scheme will be available immediately initially in boots stores and in independent pharmacies other pharmacies are being asked to sign up to the programme during the previous lockdown in england in november the charity refuge which runs the national domestic abuse helpline said it was very concerned by the continuing upward trend in demand for its services after the first lockdown the counting dead women project told mps that between march and april at least domestic abuse killings had taken place far higher than the average for the time of year the pharmacybased initiative was first proposed during a hidden harms web summit hosted by boris johnson in june which examined some of the repercussions of lockdown in a commons statement victoria atkins the safeguarding minister said the scheme would offer a vital lifeline to all victims ensuring they get help in a safe and discreet way but jess phillips a shadow home office minister who speaks on domestic violence and safeguarding called for more backing for support services domestic abuse and community support services are currently planning for redundancies in march quite unbelievable in the middle of a global pandemic and a

im watching my son use his tools carefully pencils forks the fiddly bits on his toys im not just doing this for our benefit although his propensity for scribbling on our sofa is prodigious but because im doing important science my wife first noticed his lefthandedness a few weeks ago since then weve been watching him closely to confirm her hypothesis its harder to determine than you might imagine i for example write and eat with my right hand but throw or kick a football with my left hand or foot my son isnt particularly proficient in any of those disciplines but appears to be my opposite lefthanded rightfooted ambidextrous only when it comes to hurling ready brek with his fists its remarkable we noticed to be honest my wife can hardly tell her left from her right a situation so pronounced her driving instructor has taken to writing l and r on her hands at the start of each lesson for my part i dont think ive ever noticed if someone was left or righthanded a fact confirmed when ive mentioned my sons lefthandedness to friends and had them remind me they themselves are lefthanded and it never bothered them other than when spiral notebooks leave them with dimpled forearms finding lefthandedness unremarkable is an alarmingly recent development in human history the word sinister derives from the latin for lefthanded its opposite being dexter as in dextrous meaning our forebears werent content with making lefties pariahs they also patted themselves on the back for being righthanded over their left shoulder presumably our language is littered with antileft slurs both gauche and maladroit come from french words for lefthandedness in irish a leftie is a citg a term that carried a degree of pity reflected in the fact that the word for awkward is ciotach folk suspicions about there being something nefarious demonic or yes sinister about lefthandedness appear universal odder still these traditions stem from a preliterate age meaning people were pilloried for the way they held an axe or a broom reinforcing my suspicion that the people of the past had too much time on their hands whichever one they favoured current science rejects the demonic theory and suggests hand dominance is established from gene expression in the womb around the eighth to th week of pregnancy before the brain is even connected to the hands its odd to think of that little blob still weeks away from having all its bones or intestines already destined to find spiral notebooks a faff in any case we dont find anything sinister about it were excited to have discovered something

nonfatal strangulation is a domestic terror tactic that urgently requires a change to the law according to the victims commissioner for england and wales a push to make nonfatal strangulation a criminal offence is being led by the former victims commissioner baroness newlove who is campaigning for the change via an amendment to the domestic abuse bill as it returns to the lords on tuesday dame vera baird qc the current victims commissioner said the crime was undercharged and a new law was needed to give police a tool to tackle the magnitude of the threat nonfatal strangulation is the ultimate domestic terrorist tactic she said the data shows us that this is urgent its very dangerous very prevalent and currently it is often ignored the government has said it has no plans to change the law and that nonfatal strangulation can be charged under existing legislation in a statement the ministry of justice said nonfatal strangulation is a serious crime which is already covered by existing laws such as common assault and attempted murder but baird said common assault minimised the seriousness of the crime while strangulation was often used as a means of control and intimidation rather than as an attempt at murder its not about intending to kill its about terrorising into submission she said this is a crime which has massive consequences and is a hugely powerful weapon but has no place in the current criminal lexicon an inquest into the death of annemarie nield who died during a sustained assault by her partner found he had strangled her on previous occasions two and a half years after her death the coroner expressed concerns there was still no reference to nonfatal strangulation in the police forces domestic abuse policy and a lack of understanding of the issue among officers a research project led by dr catherine white the clinical director of st marys sexual assault referral centre in manchester says nonfatal strangulation is a gendered crime with nearly all the patients female and the alleged perpetrators male strangulation or suffocation was the second most common method of killing in female homicides accounting for of adult women according to the femicide census compared with of male homicides according to ons figures nogah ofer a lawyer with the centre for womens justice which has campaigned for a new offence said nonfatal strangulation was commonly used in domestic abuse cases domestic abuse support workers on the ground tell us strangulation is undercharged she said although its a really terrifying and serious form of violence there is often not a physical mark or just a red mark so police officers routinely treat it as common assault the equivalent to a slap she said she added that studies indicate that while experience of strangulation is between and in the adult population it rises to for victims of recurring abuse two studies of intimate partner violence and sexual assaults found that strangulation was involved in and of cases newlove tweeted the dabill comes to the floor of ukhouseoflords my amendments must be added to such bil more needs to be added for children of this horrific abusive cycle until the system

if e verything goes according to plan and not a lot has done since march nicole jacobs will soon be the first domestic abuse commissioner for england and wales on tuesday the domestic abuse bill which includes the creation of her role will reach its final stages in the house of lords after a threeyear delay caused by two general elections and the coronavirus pandemic can this new legislation tackle an epidemic of abuse this is a window of opportunity jacobs says we have a postcode lottery for victims of domestic abuse weve had refuges for over yearsand greater awareness but the public is always surprised to learn that progress in a range of areas including health housing and policing isnt where it should be we have a lot to do as soon as the first lockdown began in march jacobs organised weekly online meetings now fortnightly with representatives of all the national helplines websites and organisations working in domestic abuse to chart what was happening behind closed doors conveying the information back to ministers and national and local government and police for months use of helplines chatlines and websites has increased by hundreds of percentage points jacobs says they are the quiet ways to seek help when you cant leave the home so easily its been a horrendous year for victims of abuse in response the government provided m in emergency funding and launched an awareness campaign youarenotalone but frontline work is still desperately overstretched and underfunded so what happens when the bill becomes law for the first time it will create a statutory definition of domestic abuse that encompasses emotional coercive or controlling and economic abuse as well as physical violence other measures include a statutory duty on local authorities to provide safe accommodation to victims and their children an end to the defence of rough sex when a woman is killed and the recognition that children can be victims of abuse in their own right in addition the bill gives the commissioner appointed as designate in september duties to map services vital for pitching to the treasury for funding encourage good practice raise public awareness and hold statutory agencies and local and national government to account by publishing reports and making recommendations that require a response within days jacobs grew up in alabama and came to britain in and now has an english husband and two children southern charm married to steely determination have been honed by two decades working on the frontline of domestic abuse in her final year at university studying politics she worked as an intern at a rape crisis centre and her first job was in the field of domestic abuse and thats where she has stayed ive never wanted to do anything else my frustration is knowing there is good practice out there but its patchy and theres no reason for that its time to make good practice common practice im hardheaded im persistent and assertive in a typically nice southern way because i know these are the right things to do jacobs intends to knock hard on doors rather than take a softer route that could lead to honours for her but little real change my view of the role is to advise government but never step back from applying pressure my job is to bring things to light a signal of her intent is her support for more than halfadozen amendments to the bill that she and an army of campaigners including mps peers and organisations such as the centre for womens justice the prison reform trust and southall black sisters have been able to refine since the bill went to the commons last year people say this is a landmark piece of legislation and its been a long time coming jacob says but the fact is without these improvements you cant truly call it a landmark these include the extension to communitybased services of the statutory duty on local authorities to provide secure accommodation to survivors and their children without that these services will be exposed to further cuts says jacobs wed go a long way to addressing the postcode lottery if we can secure their funding currently migrant women with no recourse to public funds are excluded from the bill unless they are included their options are brutal jacobs saysanother amendment addresses the need to make nonfatal strangulation a separate offence as it is in new zealand at present if recognised at all it is treated as common assault yet strangulation occurs in a third of killings of women by men a recognition of the effect of sustained abuse on women who go on to kill or offend such as drug offences on behalf of an abuse perpetrator is in two other amendments early in my career i volunteered at a womens prison jacobs says a lot of offending was linked to domestic abuse those are the people who have stayed with me the wasted potential and the injustice another amendment addresses the need to make postseparation control an offence a perpetrator for instance may continue for years to rack up debts in an expartners name the governments reaction is that legislation on stalking or harassment covers this issue but it really doesnt jacobs says that has to be remedied these amendments are the just thing to do in numbers million the number of people aged between and who were abused in the year ending march million women and men the increase in the number of calls to the national domestic abuse helpline in marchmay reported by refuge the increase in the number of calls to the womens aid chat line service in first two weeks of lockdown in march the increase from may to

jane monckton smith is a criminologist specialising in domestic homicide a former police officer she is professor of public protection at the university of gloucestershire and is recognised for her groundbreaking work on coercive control and stalking in her new book in control dangerous relationships and how they end in murder she lays out the eight stages of a domestic homicide timeline that flag up the potential for the coercively controlling to kill what is the empirical basis for your eightstage homicide timeline the empirical basis is the data we collected for a research project it looks at domestic abuse through the model of coercive control the home office did a review of domestic abuse in and said that coercive control is the best lens through which to view it the traditional lens has been the crime of passion and from my work that doesnt fit as a homicide researcher i have used or seen used temporal sequencing in other forms of homicide and nobody had done it really with domestic abuse is the socalled crime of passion argument still used in court and is it ever effective yes if you define the crime of passion as a spontaneous response to some kind of trigger confrontation or challenge you act spontaneously and you grab the nearest weapon and things turn out in a way that nobody could have predicted thats what i would call the crime of passion and thats how things are very often argued in court because if you can argue for crime of passion you will probably reduce your charge from murder to manslaughter it gets used a lot its due to the way that we have understood domestic abuse as an anger management problem its spontaneous when somebodys been drinking or after an argument but that is not how coercive control works at all stage one is a history of control how can women establish this and what should the courts do about recognising it as evidence we already accept that a history of control or domestic abuse is predictive of more abuse because weve got the domestic violence disclosure scheme if we didnt think history had any importance we wouldnt have that but we do so the police can tell a victim look your partner has got a history but i think in the eight stages if the very first stage is somebody with a history were saying theyre a type and people dont like that and dont want to think that they prefer to think its more spontaneous so should the starting point of any relationship be to establish previous history i think it should be the clues are very often there in what the person says about themselves and maybe more importantly what other people say about them if i was going into a relationship and someone said to me my crazy exgirlfriend i would automatically think here we go that is a big red flag this is a risk assessment im not trying to convict anyone of domestic abuse im asking are you the type and if i think youre the type my radar will be more finely tuned to other behaviours i have to look out for risk assessment isnt a precise science you refer to stage two as the commitment whirlwind many romantic tropes like love at first sight underpin this idea how can we distinguish love from danger what i would say is did you have stage one first when people think theyre in love theyre totally happy for things to go really fast and some of those relationships will be ok but i would say the relationship wont just be pushed along at a speed but also with all of these possessive things going on like pronounced jealousy these things can happen in a normal relationship but if youve got someone with a history of control who is then going very fast youve got loads of flags you question the effectiveness of the adversarial system in courts because it places the victim in opposition to the offender what is the alternative no system is devoid of problems but we know weve got an adversarial system so we need to be able to circumvent some of the problems it raises if lawyers and judges had more knowledge about how domestic abuse works that would then become part of the adversarial arguments i also think courts need to recognise the power dynamic youve got someone whos willing and happy to have arguments and the victim will do anything to avoid arguing with this person we dont even give them equal status the victim doesnt have a dedicated advocate and the offender does recognise those power dynamics and the way theyre used by controlling people people often wonder why the abused dont leave their abusers youve had personal experience from your daughters relationship with a controlling narcissist was she scared to leave him or did she hold on to a belief that he would come good she was very frightened and for good reason but she had also had all of her choices taken away as well a lot of women who talk about this will say i recognised that this was about control and i thought that if i made them feel very stable within the relationship that need for control would disappear but of course it doesnt no amount of love or stability will take away those control issues for some people its definitely a bit of the good times are really good i just want to make the good times longer and longer overlaid with a very real fear of what will happen that the bad person will come back with a vengeance if they tried to leave because thats the main trigger point what should people do if they have a friend or a relation involved with a controlling and possibly abusive partner what you think you would do is go in all guns blazing get everyone to see sense remove your daughter from the relationship and then its all over and thats not what happens from my own experience and research its dangerous to just remove the person from the relationship very often theyre not going to want to go for lots of reasons fear being one of them so you have to create an environment where its safe to leave and that is hard because what you want to do is go round there and sort it out as a former police officer what would you like to see the police do about domestic control and violence from a very broad perspective id like to see domestic abuse given more status i think we need to stop seeing it as an argument between people and start seeing it as a dangerous situation in which somebody has become a threat to somebody else we tend to assess domestic abusers as husbands boyfriends lovers we dont think of them as psychopaths narcissists killers we need to make that leap you mention that many murders go unrecognised do you have any idea what kind of percentage of domestic murders in the uk that amounts to we could double it certainly if you start bringing in suicides you could probably multiply it by five six or seven times if weve got a serial killer theyre given a huge amount of forensic attention as are terrorists why not domestic killers why have we still got that really low status police officers are not rushing into the domestic abuse department its

the pandemic has had a devastating impact on women in abusive relationships trapping them in their homes with violent manipulative or controlling men the un described the global increase in domestic abuse as a shadow pandemic and in the first seven weeks of lockdown there was a domestic abuse call to uk police every seconds the centre for womens justice noted the number of domesticabuserelated deaths trebled in the uk in compared with at the heart of this storm are womens refuges places of sanctuary that have seen their funding slashed in recent years how are refuges coping here we follow one manager over the course of a month december every few days anna receives an urgent call a woman needs a room immediately this is one of those days there had been an incident quite recently the police were involved and she needed to flee says anna but despite the desperate situation there is nothing anna can do christmas is always chaotic this year especially so the refuge is full anna says it has been all year she spends the morning ringing other hostels is there anywhere that may be able to fit the woman in anna is a refuge manager at idas a specialist independent charity supporting people affected by domestic and sexual violence in the north of england before the pandemic she tried to keep at least one of the eight rooms in her refuge free for women in urgent need if necessary she could hold it for a day or two to give the prospective occupant enough time to pack say goodbye to family and friends and most importantly plan an escape this is especially important because leaving an abuser is the most dangerous time for victims of domestic abuse but now there is a waiting list and free spaces are snapped up immediately anna a mother of two has been a refuge manager for years born and bred in yorkshire she is warm and open but matteroffact you cant be a crusading dogooder and run a refuge its too dispiriting after so many years witnessing violence against women and girls up close idealism crystallises into pragmatism anna knows now that she wont be able to help all the women in her care some of whom will return to violent abusers but she has made peace with that the most she can do is keep them safe while they are under her roof to that she is absolutely committed anna finds a space for the woman but it is in the south of england there are a lot fewer refuge spaces available on the system that refuge managers have access to because of covid anna explains a new railtorefuge scheme which allows survivors with a confirmed refuge place to travel free by train in england scotland and wales will cover the womans transport costs and as anna is preparing to go home for the day the doorbell goes its a woman dropping off a full christmas dinner she said that idas helped her in the past says anna anna is touched but not surprised all week donations have been pouring in chocolates and toiletries for the women toys and board games for the kids its testament to the generosity of their local community but its more than that almost one in three women will experience domestic abuse at some point in their life at this time of year at christmas its not something you forget december today is the refuges christmas party shrieking children unwrap presents donated by local people under the lights of a twinkling christmas tree staff members hover on the edges of the party cake scones and jam are laid out on a table molly a specialist childrens worker has set up party games for the children the grownups play bingo they dance to christmas music looking around anna is glad to see that fatima is there in her early s she arrived a few weeks ago and is the youngest resident she was brought to the uk for a forced marriage and her husband was violent the marriage fell apart quickly but returning to her family is not an option she has experienced horrific abuse says anna her exhusband did really degrading things to her fatimas english is limited the staff do their best to communicate with her but there arent any suitable interpreters and google translate has its limits she was a university student in her country says anna when you say you must be very smart she beams its as if no one has ever said anything lovely to her fatima spends most of her time in her room coming out only to ask staff to go to the supermarket for her shes too scared to go out by herself but today fatima is holding a cake she has baked she sets it down with the rest of the buffet food and gingerly perches herself at the fringes of the party looking on she stays at the party for minutes before it gets too much and she slips back to her room she wouldnt have done that two weeks ago says anna theres no way it is a tiny faltering step forward but it is progress december anna is visiting a domesticabuse survivor she had heard on the grapevine that the young mum was struggling she arrives with armfuls of presents when she opened the door she started crying bless her says anna the woman fled an abusive partner from another part of the uk she doesnt know anyone nearby and is isolated and lonely anna talks to her on the doorstep for half an hour while her children open their presents the womens refuge movement emerged in the uk in the s a refuge in chiswick west london was the first created by secondwave feminists battered wives saw discreet newspaper advertisements and fled arriving at the ramshackle residential house which had mattresses on the floor and lengths of brown hessian demarcating personal space the refuge movement expanded rapidly from there most were set up in womens spare rooms or in basements says prof nicole westmarland of durham university an expert in male violence against women they offered not just a safe space but were consciousnessraising places where women could realise that domestic violence was a political issue rooted in genderbased inequality today the sector is highly professionalised annas refuge has six members of staff and each room is a selfcontained unit with a kitchenette table and fridge the bigger rooms can house a woman and up to six children there is also an institutionallooking lounge with games for the children sofas and a tv and a small garden all the rooms are full and five of the women are mothers so there are eight schoolage children in the refuge december when she arrives anna runs into melissa a mum in her s and her children tommy a toddler and emily who is under emily twirls around to show anna her new dress a gift from the christmas party she was so giddy anna says she told me that she had a lovely party and got lots of presents emily chatters excitedly about school if you saw her this morning says anna youd just see a happy little girl in a sparkly outfit youd have no idea what went on behind the scenes but at times emily will recall details of her fathers abuse reciting in a matteroffact almost singsong way how for instance he used to shout at her mum all the time other children react to the trauma they have experienced by becoming taciturn there was a family in earlier this year the children wouldnt speak says anna their dad would go mad if they spoke at home because he didnt want them making noise molly helped them with play therapy building up their trust until their thoughts and feelings about the abuse came tumbling out because of the funding shortages faced by refuges not all can provide this other refuges anna notes have to raise money through raffles and fun runs for these vital child support workers december on the helpline an idas staffer jill receives a disturbing phone call it is a woman called maria her partner has been abusing her for decades the violence is extreme but she doesnt have much evidence like police or hospital visits now marias partner is posing as the victim this is something that jill has experienced more of during covid they try to manipulate you jill says idas does support male survivors of domestic abuse and violence sometimes the men make false allegations so they can claim for legal aid at other times they want to punish their victims jill recently fielded a call from a perpetrator whose expartner had left him and taken their daughter with her he told me that he wanted her done says jill for taking his daughter marias partner has secured temporary custody of their children her world has fallen apart says jill shes lost her children hes got away with beating her black and blue for years and now shes starting a battle from scratch to prove that hes been abusing her there is nothing in the system about the abuse where does she start december the refuge is quiet with residents in their rooms preparing for their christmas celebrations a local beauty bank delivers some goodies for the women the government has just made yet another uturn people in lowertier areas of england can only socialise in their christmas bubbles for one day not five for annas ladies she always calls them her ladies the announcement was a blow they were looking forward to visiting their family and friends on christmas she chats to emma a resident in her s with a small child theyre getting ready for a walk in the park she had been planning to visit her mum on christmas eve and have a friend over for a boxing day lunch now shes flat and upset she feels like her mum is missing out on watching her grandchild grow up anna says you could feel her anxiety levels getting really high emma moved into the refuge after her abusive expartner was released from prison and found her the government has been releasing inmates early to help minimise the spread of coronavirus in prisons she had stayed in a refuge previously after the abuse had escalated to the point that social services had taken her child into care this time emma took charge and asked to come back to the refuge she didnt want to stay in that situation and have social care remove her child again anna says emma can be one of annas trickier ladies to deal with as she puts it delicately it was a big decision for her to come here because shes not someone who likes to live under other peoples rules but she knows the refuge is the best place for her right now the truth is no one wants to live in a refuge theyre institutional spaces where women from all walks of life have to rub together regardless of whether they get on staff do their best to make the space as homely as it can be before a new resident moves in they make sure the room has matching bed linen and toys for the children but theres a limit to what they can do before anna managed the refuge she ran a hostel for homeless people a bed hostel for single homeless men with complex needs is easier to run than an eightbed refuge she says because single men just want a place to wash and sleep for the night but when women come to refuge they have to flee a perpetrator theyre cutting ties with family and friends they have to switch their phones location services off ive seen ladies who have been abused for plus years they may have drug and alcohol problems or severe mental health issues some have never been independent staff become everything to them a few years ago they had a resident who had never even had a haircut or any money of her own because she wasnt allowed out of the house she would harm herself so the perpetrator would take her to hospital we are social workers drug and alcohol workers and mental health workers it can be chaos idas also runs a phone line and community outreach service with three other refuges initially in the first lockdown in march referrals dropped women simply couldnt get away from their abusers for long enough to use a phone and when they did their calls often went unanswered as council housing officers struggled to set up remote working but in april the floodgates opened its been relentless says laura who manages community outreach between april and december idas managed referrals in the same time period in the figure was an increase of on average laura now manages referrals a week before covid it was closer to alarmingly many of these referrals are high risk women who are facing serious harm or even murder such referrals often come through the police lockdown has exacerbated a lot of abusive situations people are getting to that breaking point much sooner says laura its the same pattern across england and wales the office for national statistics reports a increase in domesticabuse related police calls from march to june compared with the stay at home messaging meant many women felt they couldnt escape during the first covid lockdown says westmarland men too a report westmarland coauthored with colleagues at durham university found that calls to the mens advice line a ukwide service for male victims of domestic abuse increased from calls in march to in may the highest since the service began in it is too easy to blame the pandemic says cordelia tucker osullivan of the domestic violence charity refuge covid doesnt cause domestic abuse she says its not about being cooped up and angry and lashing out domestic abuse is primarily a result of gender inequality male entitlement power and control the surge in demand is because the pandemic has intensified the situation for victims they may have had respite dropping children off at school or visiting a relative says tucker osullivan these opportunities for breathing space are now gone local authorities are not legally obliged to house people fleeing domestic violence so most refuges are funded by a mixture of local authority police and central government budgets and there hasnt been enough money in the pot for a long time over the past decade refuge has seen funding cuts to around of our services says tucker osullivan for many women fleeing violence the consequences are stark they simply may not be given a space in a refuge when they need it of refuge referrals in england were declined last year and the main reason was lack of bed space says tucker osullivan womens aid a national domesticviolence charity found that of the victims turned away because of a lack of space in slept rough one with her son while women sofasurfed until a space became free tucker osullivan hopes the domestic abuse bill which is about to pass into law will improve matters by making it a legal duty for english local authorities to house victims and their children of the women turned away almost half were from black and ethnic minority backgrounds bame service providers have been disproportionately affected by cuts and women with no recourse to public funds because of their immigration status such as fatima can find themselves at the bottom of the list the domestic abuse bill does not make it a legal duty for refuges to house women without recourse to public funds they are massively failing a group of women who most need support says westmarland if anna cant secure funding for a woman idas will pay for their room out of its own funds december today anna has a catchup with jessica a longterm resident who is planning to move out in the new year jessica is in her s and was pushed to the edge by the pressures of the pandemic it was a lifetime of controlling behaviour says anna not necessarily physical abuse but financial and isolating her from her family and friends even her children jessica was with her partner for decades she had tried to leave before but went back women often attempt to leave their abusers several times before making a definitive break but during the first lockdown the abuse became intolerable she called the police who put her in touch with anna jessica slipped out of the house and came straight to the refuge jessica is one of their success stories she wants to do some volunteering work says anna and find a little place by the sea most importantly she is adamant that she wont go back to her abuser ever she has completely cut contact with him says anna shes talking about divorce not everyone can make as clean a break abusers are insidious charismatic calculating cruel and volatile they work their way into their victims lives like shards of glass sometimes the victims find it too painful to remove them this was the case with tina who arrived about five or six years ago she had substance abuse problems and poor mental health and when she left the refuge she promised anna and jill who was also working on her case she would stay with a friend jill worked with the local authoritys housing team to place her in safe accommodation but tina was chaotic and didnt always answer her phone i suspected she was going back to him jill sighs when jill got hold of tina she was indeed back with her partner i said to her i need you to understand that in my professional opinion i dont think youre safe but tina wanted to stay a few days later jill saw on the news that there had been a fire on tinas road she knew instantly what had happened hours later the fire brigade called it was a probable murder accelerant had been used tina and her partner were dead i know in my heart of hearts that i did everything i could says jill after a pause but i couldnt stop her going back to him and i couldnt save her december most of the residents have left to visit family its just jessica and fatima on christmas morning fatima has nowhere to go and jessica doesnt feel safe visiting her children in case her exhusband tracks her down luckily the two women have become friends in the afternoon lorna returns shes in her s and moved into the refuge in the autumn she spent christmas eve with her child but was too frightened to stay lest her exhusband turn up for every woman who flees a domestic abuser after a sudden explosion of violence there are women like lorna who are gradually worn down she got to the end of her tether says anna there was a lot of controlling behaviour she didnt have access to money there were a lot of subtle putdowns she was stuck in the house with him telling her that she couldnt go to the shops or see her friends and she finally realised that what she was living with wasnt normal lornas room is next door to alesha a woman in her s alesha is a night owl who likes to play music and chat to friends on the phone it drives lorna crazy but not tonight not a creature is stirring all is still and all is well and all is calm in the refuge this christmas day january a third national lockdown has been announced schools are to close except for the children of key workers women in refuges are allowed to continue to send their children to schools to minimise the disruption to their childrens lives legally the refuge counts as one household meaning that residents dont have to wear masks in communal areas but they are allowed to form support bubbles with another household outside the refuge which poses a challenge for staff safety we dont know how many bubbles theyre forming people dont always keep to the rules anna sighs her office is in the middle of the refuge and women often drop in for a chat without wearing masks but annas main concern today is holly a mother in her s with three children all younger than they fled hollys expartner recently he is an arsonist and violent too but two of her children are refusing to go to school theyre anxious they say they wont know anybody molly the childrens worker tries to persuade them but it doesnt work so she sets up home schooling for them instead parenting in a refuge is hard mums may let their children skip homework or have mcdonalds for dinner because they feel guilty taking them away from home its mollys job to encourage them to reimpose boundaries shes really good at making sure the kids get back into a routine anna says school is the best place for them they need the discipline january jill and fatima go for a walk its only the second time fatima has left the refuge and the first time unaccompanied by a staff member she seems so much brighter now says anna of fatima shes cooking and eating middle eastern food with the other ladies which she never used to do january a snow day school is cancelled anna tries to drive to work but her car is skidding all over the road and she has to turn back the mums take their kids sledging at a park its a good day january alesha is upset her children are in foster care it was a violent volatile relationship and the children were removed because of it says anna her only hope of getting her children back is not to be in that relationship alesha came to the refuge in the hope of escaping her abuser since then she has been fighting to get her children back she hasnt seen them for more than a month but now she has been told her family court hearing has been delayed for another month because of the pandemic she said that nothing ever goes her way says anna nothing ever goes right january lorna is moving out shes returning to her abuser its the way it goes sometimes the main thing is to make sure things are as safe as possible lornas house is tagged by police so that if theres an incident they will come out straight away it is not that anna has failed lornas experience in the refuge has been positive shes close to her children again she has regained some selfesteem shes had a taste of what life can be like says anna even though to some it might feel like a backwards step shes moved on more than she would have done had she not come here yet anna cant help but feel lorna might have stayed if it wasnt for covid people are isolated in domesticabuse relationships and then they come to the refuge to flee but theyre still isolated because they cant see their friends or leave anna looks around the clearedout room then goes back to her office to check the new referrals within hours there is a new occupant a woman in her mids who was violently assaulted by a family member just before christmas hes in prison now on remand two more of annas ladies are moving on next week but to council properties among them are melissa and little emily melissa is overjoyed more women will arrive immediately the cycle of male violence does not stop but refuges like annas

mps have voted to give ministers formal paid maternity leave for the first time hailed as an important and long overdue change as the government pledged to bring forward more sweeping maternity protections before the summer recess however the move to give the attorney general suella braverman six months paid leave drew accusations of double standards during the parliamentary debate including over the omission of any reference to paternity leave and the failure to extend similar benefits to backbenchers some mps also protested over the language in the bill which refers to a person rather than a woman which minister penny mordaunt said was not a policy decision around language mordaunt said the bill put an end to the wholly unacceptable situation of a minister having to resign in order to take leave braverman is expecting her baby at the end of february giving her backing to the bill caroline nokes the conservative chair of the women and equalities select committee said it was a mess that the issues had not been resolved in a more considered matter what a mess that it is well into the st century before we have had to face this situation and why oh why did it cross nobodys mind that we might need to address this prior to it having the urgency it now does she said is it really that unthinkable that a secretary of state or one of the law officers could become heavens above pregnant nokes said the legislation does not go far enough as it fails to address adoption leave or shared parental leave noting that she wanted reassurances that swift action would follow to deal with remaining issues two pregnant backbench mps spoke in the debate raising the disparity labour mp feryal clark who is due to give birth at the end of april said she was scared about taking informal maternity leave im scared that it will be used against me politically and most depressing of all im scared that beneath the warm words of good luck and congratulations some members will take a dim view of my taking of maternity leave at all clark said stella creasy who is pregnant with her second child has said she will consider legal action unless similar benefits are extended to backbenchers i want to be clear with the government they have made some commitments today but like the suffragettes said this has got to be deeds not words i am early on in my pregnancy i shouldnt have to reveal that but i am doing that today to be very clear to pregnant women around this country that they will find champions in this place that it is not enough that we only act for that small group of women at the top of our society we must act for every woman to be able to have maternity leave labour mp and mother of the house harriet harman said the bill should be an impetus to address low maternity pay the government have done the right thing by the attorney general and women cabinet ministers now they need to put right the completely wrong situation for the rest of the women in the country and what they face she said statutory maternity pay is only per week and at that it is less than half of what you would get on the national minimum wage so her income is clobbered just when she needs to be spending more honestly if men had babies do we really think that maternity pay would be so insultingly low not a chance some mps including labours tonia antoniazzi the conservatives sir edward leigh and the snps joanna cherry said they did not agree with the language in the bill antoniazzi said the fact that it refers to a person who is pregnant and doesnt mention woman women she at any point is totally at odds with all other maternity rights and protection legislation mordaunt the paymaster general said it had been a particular drafting issue but said i do understand how offensive the word person or persons can be in this context and i hope that we can make some changes if not to the legislation but to the explanatory notes the ministerial and other

labour will back measures allowing sixmonth maternity leave for cabinet ministers through a bill rushed through parliament later on thursday but will demand a commitment to tackle maternity protections for women during the pandemic as a price for its support the legislation has provoked a backlash among mps and campaigners because it will offer six months paid leave only to ministers not backbenchers and will give ministers far more generous rights than the general public the bill will speed through parliament in a day to ensure provision is in place for the attorney general suella braverman who is expected to give birth within weeks labour will support the ministerial and other maternity allowances bill but sources said there would be a number of concessions from the minister penny mordaunt pledging immediate action on maternity discrimination the government committed in to strengthening protections for pregnant women in the employment bill on which there has been little progress it comes amid concerns that pregnant women have been disproportionately selected for redundancy during the pandemic others were unlawfully placed on sick pay when pregnant women were advised to shield affecting their maternity entitlement the bill promises to extend redundancy protection to pregnant employees and maternity returners and introduce leave for neonatal care cat smith mp labours shadow minister for democracy said the speed with which the government is acting to make sure the attorney general can take maternity leave is in stark contrast to its failure to support pregnant women facing discrimination and hardship throughout this pandemic it is right that the attorney general is granted maternity rights but the government must not turn the clock back on employment rights for women and leave pregnant mothers without the basic protections they need the government hopes to use parliamentary procedure to avoid amendments on the bill a move expected to be backed by labour mordaunt is understood to have told concerned mps that there is not enough time before bravermans due date to pass more complex arrangements and the government has threatened it will pull the bill entirely if opposition mps try to amend it however stella creasy the senior labour mp who is also in the early stages of pregnancy is threatening to take the government to court for discrimination for giving better rights to ministers than mps creasy the mp for walthamstow said she had been given legal advice that the move could be a breach of human rights law of a right to equal treatment and the right to a family life she said she does not begrudge braverman her maternity leave but she would be prepared to make a legal case that she had been discriminated against as a backbench mp with fewer rights than more senior colleagues she said it would be a case intended to highlight the discrimination faced by pregnant women across all sectors a coalition of a dozen womens and charitable organisations led by the centenary action group which campaigns on womens representation and participation in politics wrote to the government warning that if the bill passed without any further reforms it would set a precedent of a twotier system of maternity and paternity rights the letter added that while it was welcome that government ministers would get six months maternity leave on full pay statutory maternity pay and maternity allowance is just per week equivalent to about half of the national minimum wage,2021-02,labour back measure allowing sixmonth maternity leave

stella creasy the senior labour mp is threatening to take the government to court over a bill giving six months paid maternity leave to cabinet ministers only as she discloses she is nine weeks pregnant creasy told the guardian it was terrifying to reveal she was in the early stages of pregnancy especially with a history of miscarriage but she felt she was left with no alternative to draw attention to a system that would effectively award better maternity rights as a reward for political promotion like a company car last week the government announced plans to change the law to give cabinet ministers six months maternity leave in order to allow the attorney general suella braverman to keep her post after having a baby it faced a backlash as it emerged that backbench mps would be denied similar rights however the guardian understands the government is hoping the tight scope of the bill along with labours support will mean it can avoid any amendments being put forward to the bill which will be laid before parliament on thursday labour will back its move to pass the bill swiftly before bravermans baby is due at the end of the month despite some concerns the current bill will only apply to secretaries of state and award more paid leave to cabinet ministers than the general public are entitled to creasy who is pregnant with her second child pioneered a system of having a locum mp in place to continue her constituency work when she had her first child in but had to fight for support from the mps funding body in order to hire cover she has been the only mp to gain that funding with several others privately admitting they feel there is no formal transparent system for mps apart from adhoc requests for funding where the burden is on the pregnant woman creasy the mp for walthamstow said she had been given legal advice that the move could be a breach of human rights law of a right to equal treatment and the right to a family life she said she does not begrudge braverman her maternity leave but she would be prepared to make a legal case that she had been discriminated against as a backbench mp with fewer rights than more senior colleagues she said it would be a case intended to highlight the discrimination faced by pregnant women across all sectors theres no difference between myself and the attorney general in terms of the impact of having a baby on you she said we are in an environment where thousands of pregnant women are facing risks in the workplace including the risk of the loss of their job the message that were sending is that we treat maternity leave like a benefit like a company car in other words only paid maternity leave for management she said it was an extreme measure for any mp to consider legal action but she believed she had been misled two years ago that swift reform to maternity rights was not possible when now the government intended to pass a bill in a single day this piece of legislation only helps a spectacularly small number of women she said for the last two years ive been listening to assurances that people would get on and do something about these anomalies so that were not in a position where if you are a woman or a man of childbearing or child rearing age you are a risk to elect creasy said the current system for getting cover for backbench mps was severely lacking nobody knows what that cover is how long it lasts what its supposed to pay for unlike ministers who will have a clearly defined benefit lawyers had advised that there was an arguable case that she was being discriminated against she said its classic suffragettes deeds not words if there is not progress tomorrow if ministers words dont lead to action then i am prepared to take this further creasy said she had decided it was necessary to take the step of revealing she was pregnant herself and directly affected its terrifying because i have a history of failed pregnancies and im still at an early stage but if this goes well i have just as much of a deadline as the attorney general as do the other pregnant women across the country while labour will support the bill they are expected to raise a number of key concerns including pregnant women unlawfully being put on statutory sick pay during the pandemic affecting maternity pay and other entitlements cat smith the shadow minister for democracy said the speed with which the government is acting to make sure the attorney general can take maternity leave is in stark contrast to its failure to support pregnant women facing discrimination and hardship throughout this pandemic it is right that the attorney general is granted maternity rights but the government must not turn the clock back on employment rights for women and leave pregnant mothers without the basic protections they need joeli brearley founder of the campaign group pregnant then screwed said campaigners had spent years pleading with the government to do more for pregnant women it has fallen on deaf ears with a trail of broken promises and empty rhetoric said brearley now that one of their team is pregnant and needs support they have rushed through a bill to make sure she is properly remunerated and protected a coalition of a dozen women and charitable organisations led by the centenary action group told the government that if the bill passed without further reforms it would set a precedent of a twotier system of maternity and paternity rights the group cited research from the tuc that found one in four pregnant women reported discrimination at work during the pandemic and research from the institute for fiscal studies that mothers were more likely than fathers to have lost their jobs during the pandemic,2021-02,stella creasy senior labour mp

since she was a child and its inordinately pleasing depicting each of irelands counties in red blue green and yellow so you can slot them all together she takes great pride in how quickly she can complete it two minutes and how long it takes me to do the same closer to five minutes without ever conceding that she has had a year head start and the privilege of an education in the republic of ireland there the lower threequarters of the island are actually acknowledged as opposed to the tv news of my own northern irish childhood which insisted that the bottom part of the landmass didnt even have weather had my son any respect for irish nationhood he would have sat down and marvelled at the little squiggly pieces in front of him and set to work arranging them into the earshaped island we know and love instead he clumped a few pieces into corners where they did not belong before picking up every last county and hurling it as far as he could as a metaphor for my sons ambivalence towards his irish heritage this would be heavyhanded enough to make it into the canon of great early thcentury irish theatre but unfortunately the only boards he and i were now treading

more bits and bobs than a catalan cathedral unfortunately if predictably these sessions never end with a clap of the hands and a careful tidyup of his workspace no they always terminate with some small error some gap in his abilities raising his anger to a fever pitch that results in the entire edifice being destroyed by his own hand transforming our little gaudi into a little godzilla in a matter of seconds its intriguing to observe this nascent anger with creation his earliest annoyance with himself over a job poorly done but luckily like any great craftsman his tantrums never last too long soon hes padding toward me with something in his hand he puts galway clare and limerick on the board as far away from their actual locations as would be possible in such a small space but he does

londons first commissioner for victims has revealed how misogynists are attempting to silence her attempts to tackle domestic violence claire waxman who is campaigning for amendments to the domestic abuse bill says her work is prompting an increasingly coordinated online response from largely anonymous social media accounts designed to discredit and intimidate her from continuing particularly around the area of the family courts and domestic abuse bill i have received a huge amount of abuse which has misogyny at its root people who are trying to create a gender war she said if i speak out we see the abuse intensify its to try and silence what i am seeing and the work i am doing waxman who says she is motivated to help victims after her experiences of being targeted by a stalker for more than a decade says the current abuse bears the hallmarks of group stalking where a number of social media users harass an individual its a growing phenomenon which is starting to be understood by academics which is seen a lot on social media and the tactics used to prevent legitimate voices from speaking out for fear of being targeted and abused she said waxman said that failings in the family courts needed to be urgently addressed warning that women were being encouraged to suppress allegations of domestic abuse as judges were more concerned with granting both parents access to children the family courts principle of contact at all costs for parents and their children meant abuse was repeatedly being swept under the carpet said waxman jeopardising the welfare of women and minors we see real evidence of victims of domestic abuse mainly mothers being told and advised to not bring up any mention of domestic abuse this promotion of contact at all costs means that victims of abuse are expected to put their abuse aside she said her proposed amendment to the domestic abuse bill which has been described as a onceinageneration chance to tackle the issue would introduce an initial no contact approach where there has been a conviction restraining order or other evidence of abuse waxman also warned that the current courts backlog could force domestic abuse and sexual violence victims to withdraw from the criminal justice system she warned that some individuals would prefer not to press ahead with prosecutions because of the lengthy delays in the courtsan unprecedented court backlog means some crimes will not go before a jury for four years with victims increasingly losing faith in the system and confidence already low over conviction rates for crimes like

the government has been accused of ignoring the plight of millions of parents struggling with inadequate parental leave policies while finding solutions for its own ministers trade unions campaigners and business leaders have called for a radical overhaul of parenting policy in the uk arguing that current parental leave provision is discriminatory and fails to help the poorest in society the government announced plans to change the law to give cabinet ministers six months maternity leave on thursday in order to allow the attorney general suella braverman to keep her post after having her baby but faced a backlash as it emerged that backbench mps would be denied similar rights on friday frances ogrady general secretary of the trades union congress tuc said parents across the uk particularly mothers were carrying the burden of the governments failed policies the uks parental leave system is not fit for purpose genuine flexible working is still unavailable to millions and quality childcare is hard to find and unaffordable for many she said with the uk at the point of rebuilding its economy for a postcovid world ministers had to urgently strengthen rights and support for working parents or womens equality could go into reverse she added tuc research found that the level of paid maternity leave for employed women in the uk six weeks at of average weekly earnings weeks at is one of the lowest in europe ranking out of among european countries additionally one in four fathers dont qualify for two weeks paternity leave paid at mothers who are on zerohours contracts selfemployed or unemployed receive maternity allowance of a week for weeks there is no equivalent for their partners only around three in seven families are eligible for shared parental leave a policy introduced by the coalition government in and of those only about to have shared any leave at all said ros bragg director of maternity action we know that many pregnant women and new mothers have lost their jobs in the recession and many more are at significant risk she said its particularly important that women are not compelled to take leave for the entirety of a childs first year purely because the system is so poorly designed but the governments move to protect the job of its attorney general could be positive for millions of struggling parents said adrienne burgess of the fatherhood institute i think the government is holding itself hostage to fortune if it is going to push this through how can they argue against reforming the parental leave system she said

the government is facing a backlash over plans to change the law to give cabinet ministers six months maternity leave on full pay allowing the attorney general suella braverman to keep her post after having her baby but excluding backbench mps from similar rights labour will back the move but it has caused some disquiet among backbench mps angry that the maternity rights will only apply to secretaries of state and go further than those that apply to the general public under existing laws braverman would have to resign if she wanted to take time off following the birth mps are entitled to take paid maternity leave but are not automatically guaranteed any cover meaning in practice many do not take leave despite its backing labour is concerned that no provisions have been made for paternity leave or other parental rights because of the urgency of having the measures in place before braverman gives birth at the end of the month the tuc said it was concerned the bill would amount to a twotier system and had broader implications for workers rights a number of feminist organisations including the centenary action group and the fawcett society also raised concerns about the bill and have called for the scope to be wider it is understood that some mps are looking at amending the bill though so far they have been told its scope means it cannot be expanded to include backbenchers labours stella creasy who campaigned for mps to have the right to locum cover while on maternity leave said the bill presented parental rights as a bonus for being promoted and not for those in the lower ranks in no other workplace would guaranteed paid maternity leave and cover be only the preserve of the management she told the guardian the introduction of cover for ministers is long overdue and this legislation reveals the lie i was told when i asked for maternity cover that mps employment status made it impossible two years on the situation has not changed and other mps who have tried to get cover have been let down what message does it send to the thousands of pregnant women facing redundancy and job insecurity in the pandemic or any of those considering entering public life at any level if parliament treats maternity leave as a bonus like a company car to be given only to those at the top labour sources said the government had committed to further broader legislation before the summer recess that would address paternity or shared parental leave adoption leave and potentially sickness leave for ministers on a crossparty basis rachel reeves shadow cabinet office minister said it was a small but significant step forward for womens rights in parliament but said there remained gaps in the legislation this bill is already out of date with no provisions for paternity adoption or shared parental leave labour intends to hold the government to their word to work crossparty to introduce comprehensive legislation she said previous rules would have meant braverman would have had to resign if she had wanted to take any leave or had her ministerial duties split between other ministers rather than have a fulltime replacement whips have indicated that they hope to pass the whole bill in a single day on thursday the guardian understands that labour believes the major outstanding issues with the bill cannot be resolved in time for braverman to take her maternity leave the party will not table any amendments from the front bench though backbenchers may still try to amend the bill adding paternity and shared parental leave to the bill could potentially create a loophole where ministers and their employed partners could both take six months paid leave together giving ministers greater rights than the general public the tucs general secretary frances ogrady said all workers should have access to decent paid maternity and paternity leave including mps and ministers there shouldnt be a twotier system that privileges some new mums helen pankhurst who leads the centenary action group which campaigns on womens representation and participation in politics said it was one rule for the cabinet and another for mps who still dont have maternity rights or any formal parental leave pankhurst the greatgranddaughter of emmeline pankhurst said in february the government gave the right to vote to only some women and it took another years for women to be given equal voting rights as men we cant wait another years for parliament to be fit for the st century felicia willow chief executive of the fawcett society said it was now an urgent matter that mps be given paid maternity cover but urged the government to address maternity rights disparities across the country most working mothers on low incomes are expected to survive on very low statutory maternity pay or maternity allowance the payments for which will be deducted for any claims for universal credit she said the government must not only support its own but

in the immediate wake of the tragic killing of sarah everard parties across the political spectrum called for tougher action on male violence against women the government had the political capital to do something instead it promised us more street lights some undercover police officers and proposals to record misogyny as a hate crime symbolic policies that do little to reduce violence against women after half a decade reporting on the issue it should not be surprising to me that the government views female lives with such contempt and yet somehow it is there is a policy that would save lives a stalkers register proposed by the antistalking charity paladin a stalkers register would be a national database of men convicted of stalking and domestic violence the government would not need to build a new database from scratch we already have the system in place to track these often serial offenders it would simply be a matter of adding such men to the violent and sex offender register visor which is already used to keep track of sex offenders crucially these men would be monitored by police and be legally required to notify them if they were entering a new relationship police would then be responsible for notifying prospective partners about their offending history under clares law women can ask police if their partners are convicted domestic abusers however the request has to be made by the woman there is no onus on police to notify women proactively this is critical because as the criminologist prof jane moncktonsmith has identified such abusers tend to lovebomb their partners in the early stages of relationships showering them with affection and romance early intervention is key if we are to empower women to make informed choices about whether they truly want to date violent and abusive men studies have found that of domestic abuse perpetrators are repeat offenders they start off with the smaller offences testing the waters seeing how the police respond and when nothing happens in the majority of cases nothing ever happens they are emboldened their offending escalates to sometimes fatal ends the antistalking campaigner zoe dronfield was beaten and left for dead by her expartner after she ended their relationship afterwards she found out that hed stalked other women before her the only thing worse than being the first partner of a serial abuser is being their last the final partner seldom survives it is inconceivable to me that there is no existing framework to monitor serial stalkers and domestic abusers we track paedophiles rightly because such people cannot be allowed to work in our nurseries and schools why not also protect women and girls from abusive men our elected representatives agree in the home affairs select committee backed the introduction of a stalkers register as did the london assembly and the mayor of london in a petition to introduce a stalkers register has more than signatures an amendment to the domestic abuse bill proposing the introduction of a stalkers register is currently before the house of lords the amendment has just been passed meaning that mps could soon have the ability to vote on the proposals in i ran a yearlong campaign at the media publication vice calling on the government to introduce a stalkers register to protect women and girls from serial abusers i launched the unfollow me campaign because i was horrified by the case of molly mclaren who was murdered by her stalker exboyfriend joshua stimpson in mclaren reported stimpson who had a history of aggressive behaviour towards women to police before he killed her had police been able to check a stalkers register theyd have seen they had a repeat offender on their hands instead they did almost nothing and mclaren died in a chatham car park it is obvious to me that these dangerous men need to be monitored and tracked but all too often police seem apathetic about investigating reports of stalking and domestic abuse dismissing serious crimes as the romantic overtures of a rejected suitor take the case of yearold shana grice she reported her exboyfriend michael lane to the police five times for stalking before he murdered her in instead of investigating lane who had a history of abusing women sussex police fined grice for wasting police time i have looked the families of murdered women in the eyes and seen their pain people such as sue and clive ruggles their daughter alice ruggles was murdered in by her stalker exboyfriend trimaan dhillon she was years old after alice ended the relationship dhillon stalked her relentlessly alice called the police repeatedly about his harassment but they did almost nothing dhillon broke into her flat in october and slit her throat after she died sue and clive found out that a former girlfriend had taken out a restraining order against dhillon had alice known whom she was really dating she might never have had a relationship with him since her death sue and clive have made it their lifes work to introduce a stalkers register to protect other women from men like dhillon there are so many women like alice molly and shana two women a week are killed by current or former partners in the uk covid has intensified many womens experience of abuse during lockdown there was a surge in calls and contacts to domestic abuse helplines last week the guardian reported on the case of amyleanne stringfellow who was killed by her partner terence papworth in june previous girlfriends had accused papworth of extreme domestic violence papworth had abused a string of women and stringfellow was unfortunate enough to be his last men such as papworth are all the same they do not change the only thing that changes is the women whose lives they ruin and ultimately end the government has the ability and infrastructure to stop these men in their tracks and yet it does not why wont anyone join up the dots and protect women and girls from these violent men sirin kale is a

on a parenting site recommended to me a friendly stock image dad wrote that crying and crankiness were actually a good thing because tears contain cortisol the stress hormone crying is therefore just stress leaving the body not for the first time i had my usual reaction to reading a wellmeant bit of happyclappy parenting advice namely a strong desire to reach through my screen and release some of my own stress on stock image dads big smug face ive written about my sons anger before but things are coming to a real head in his case a small screaming ginger head his tantrums are so bad its hard to get him to leave the house or return to the house or induce him to perform any task on command at all one of his favourite pastimes is deciding he doesnt want to do anything at all he slumps to the ground his arms and legs flailing limply if i had to rate his tantrum tactics id put this well inside the top two or three there he lies prostrate and fuming flopping on the ground like a dropped fish in a s cartoon the genius of this technique is that it removes all of the rigid angles from his upper body making him effectively impossible to hold let alone lift this results in me grasping him by the folds of his clothing weekend at bernies style just to manoeuvre him away from stairsa footpathoncoming traffic the problem is bernie didnt put up much resistance whereas my sons constant squirming leaves me having to summon from my feeble forearms something like the tensile strength of a bear trap shredding my nerve endings until my knuckles go white my son is not yet three but has a knack for wielding his kg frame in such a way that even the most mundane parenting tasks can feel like a workout like a narky little tardis his rage expands his mass in unseen dimensions until simply getting him to sit down in a car seat is like forcing vin diesel into a pothole im sympathetic of course hes experiencing so many feelings and frustrations for the first time and he needs me to keep calm and carry on while he learns the ropes its no use me getting angry even if he is headbutting me in the park spitting in rage or screaming go away daddy just because i made him the jam sandwich he asked me to make him as much as i can i try to get to his eye level and explain quietly and with empathy why he cannot stick his hands into the wee from the toilet no matter how much he wants to while reassuring him that i understand this must be very upsetting for him indeed within a few minutes hes calmed down ready to rejoin civilisation even though he had been spitting at me just moments before

events this week have been a touch paper igniting womens anger about mens violence against women and girls and our frustration at the states failure to take this issue seriously stranger killing accounts for or one in of all killings of women by men between and women were killed by men who were not known to them yes a woman is more likely to be killed by someone she knows every three days in the uk by a man and every four days by a partner or former partner but following the killing of sarah everard we are being fed a narrative by metropolitan police chief cressida dick that it is incredibly rare for a woman to be abducted from our streets by that simple statement the met minimised the risk women face from men and intentionally diminished femicide incredibly rare should mean much more than very unusual abducted from our streets is a curious deflection strangers do abduct women but they also kill women on the street or follow them or enter their homes and friends acquaintances partners and colleagues also abduct women they know and kill them it is also far more common to be abducted from the street and raped attacked or sexually assaulted with impunity it is estimated that approximately women a year are raped of women know the man who raped them so that means women a year a day are raped by a man they dont know this isnt rare either then only one in reported rapes ends up in court a tiny minority end up with a rapist behind bars most but not all of the men who kill women are given lengthy jail sentences the majority for murder and around for manslaughter others kill themselves at the time they kill or just after with a dead body the weight of the criminal justice system gears up a living victim of rape or physical assault with firsthand evidence of the attack has little chance of securing an investigation let alone a conviction only in death does a woman gain a criminal justice advantage in two women raped by john worboys successfully sued the met over its failure to investigate previous rape allegations against the taxi driver the women argued that their human rights had not been protected because if worboys had been dealt with appropriately if earlier rape allegations had been taken seriously he would not have been at liberty to rape them at a later date it is estimated that worboys raped more than women we now hear that the met is to be investigated by the independent office for police conduct over its handling of issues relating to the disappearance of everard including alleged failures in responses to a report of a man exposing himself at a fastfood restaurant in south london three days before everards disappearance policing problems are not restricted to the met a super complaint led by the centre for womens justice filed in march documents reports over three years of domestic abuse incidents and offences perpetrated by police officers community support officers and other staff from of england and waless police forces how can women trust the police and a criminal justice system when our complaints of mens violence are so inadequately responded to and when the police themselves are implicated in that abuse last week the observer launched its end femicide campaign to push for change it uses data from our femicide census started eight years ago because our government was not properly counting the extent of mens fatal violence towards women it still doesnt every year we ask each police force in the uk for their data on women who are killed the met is the only uk police force that has never responded to our freedom of information requests after many years and eventually dicks intervention they pushed back with their own data sharing agreement though we have yet to agree on it our london data is based on the counting dead women project and media searches the problem of the state response goes much deeper than incomplete data however in reports on government strategy on violence against women and girls for and homicide was barely addressed and femicide was not named in there was one mention of supporting the introduction of domestic homicide reviews in the killing of women and girls is confined to lines again only focusing on domestic homicide ignoring the of women like sarah killed by men outside of the family has this contributed to the fact there was no change to the rates of femicide in the uk over the past years in the meantime the state is failing women and minimising violence by men against women be it at the extreme end or the countless microaggressions that women live with and never report in ways that have become second nature to us women modify their behaviour and choices because of the fear and threat of mens violence not all men are violent but all men benefit from sex inequality and all womens lives are either directly or indirectly restricted or altered by the actions of men until men stop attacking and killing women the least we should expect from the police and our government is that they dont mask the true nature of the problem the state ignoring femicide should make us all angry for every woman whose life has been ended or diminished by mens violence and its spectre we know about sarah because the media and social media picked up on her disappearance why dont the killings of all women warrant this attention the killing of around women we included in the femicide census year report barely warranted a mention even in their local press there is a pattern in who is unremarked and who gets national significant media and state attention inequalities of class race age lifestyle and disadvantage even make a difference in death there should be no hierarchy of dead women this article was amended on march an

my sons are and it was the youngers birthday this week and i made an awful cake that definitely breached my minimum cake standards i hesitate to criticise nigella but there is such a thing as too much peanut butter he looked a bit overwhelmed when we sang happy birthday and i worried all day about him and his yearold pandemic life without access to the places and people that help being make sense there is nothing i can do about that so i am fixating on the cake sitting here wondering if i have time to make a replacement i dont but i might anyway what else do i have to offer him another load of laundry because neither of my kids actually needs me now they could live independently without dying of hunger or septic shock the elder managed five weeks last summer and after an emergency remedial tutorial on what cant go in a microwave at christmas probably without fire or explosion either they can clean a loo iron trousers and brave an hmrc helpline they can make absorptionmethod rice a fromscratch pasta sauce and decent chocolate chip cookies after six months of covid testing one has more savings than i do the other is cagier but after a decade of not spending his birthday and christmas money i suspect he does too what is it like when your children grow up its like that dream where you find a strange new room in your house in a place you thought you knew every inch of except over and over again does that convey how wonderful it is every new room is fascinating theres so much going on in there things you always suspected or things you never for a second imagined and very little of it is any of your business i was not a great mother when they were younger i think i tried desperately to impose order on the chaos of life with a newborn rigid about sleep and feeds to the point of failing to appreciate the anarchic miracle of my baby sons every session of toddler play degenerated into me simply organising the lego or stuffed animals by colour and size later when the elder decided he hated school my intellectual vanity made me say and do things that still haunt me on sleepless nights being the mother of teenagers though that i love i still make mistakes loads but the way that infinite possibility and absolute frustration cohabit at that age still feels completely understandable to me its partly realising how little time i have left with them and partly losing any aspiration to control the larger your children get the more ridiculous you feel being conventionally parental i find sometimes when i suggest diffidently that the younger could leave his phone downstairs perhaps on school nights it feels like im role playing at being mum hes more sensible about screen time than i am mainly i feel like a privileged observer trying not to show my fear or to get in their way if i didnt already know it the past year has taught me quite viscerally how little i can still do for my sons i was sliding into irrelevance already a benignly pointless idiot who understands nothing about epigenetics or firstperson shooters who gets amusingly hot under the collar about recycling and embarrassed at tv sex scenes but covid rudely reminded me and my fellow parents of our essential helplessness as our childrens plans and aspirations their fun privacy and autonomy were thwarted you cant insulate them from pain of course your kid gets sick or sad they fail at something at which they were desperate to succeed it doesnt stop when they leave home either they can date a wrong un in their s feel unfulfilled in their s lose a lover at any age but if you expected to always be able to sand the rough corners off your childrens lives to a degree a privilege but one a lot of us have the pandemic showed that up for the fantasy it was when i felt most useless and sad on their behalf exams and adventures cancelled friends inaccessible my boys would shrug pat me on the head and say it was ok they were fine but they werent and it wasnt so as a nearobsolete parent at a time of unprecedented parental impotence i have been reduced to the little things really the ridiculously little ones i send daily whatsapps asking for shopping and lunch requests i supply stationery and deliver small treats they havent liked since they were six i got you a kinder egg i message like a lunatic i iron their tshirts even though no one notices or cares and who the hell irons tshirts like lesley manvilles character cathy in mum i do endless unobtrusive tidying washing plastic beakers with half an inch of fetid protein powder silt in the bottom sweeping up cereal rubble and pairing and putting away socks much of my mothering has been like this an accretion of small infinitely repeated tasks i got pregnant with the elder at now im thats years of pants separated from trousers dentists appointments booked and milk cartons crushed its at least birthday cakes and i estimate something like dinners of which were probably fishfingers sometimes i stand in the basement folding laundry at night while everyone watches tv upstairs and find myself saying out loud this is my life in a sort of wondering way its not a complaint exactly but a recognition an acceptance i dont think i expected mothering to be so allconsuming for so long back when i was but i dont think i expected to enjoy it this much either im deeply ambivalent about that it arouses a reflexive feminist unease and its hard to write about without sounding selfsatisfied the kind of mother who puts most important job in the world on her social media profiles id rather have taken them bareback riding across mongolia or something and that most important job in the world discourse seems like horseshit to me the most important jobs in the world right now are logistics management at astrazeneca and icu nurse surely i never expected to become a cathy finding an ecstatic martyrdom in selfeffacing domesticity i thought i would be like my own mum the breadwinner fiercely loving fiercely inspiring fired up on our behalf but with a distinct life and ambitions of her own im not though im just stodgily there asking how was your day darling and what do you fancy for dinner i know its not really in anyones interests for me to do this stuff for my sons and they dont expect me to it does them and the world a disservice to send out entitled manbabies as a counterbalance i have tried to engrain habits that will make them into nicer people to live with taking out the bins and emptying the dishwasher without waiting to be asked not finishing the good chocolate or leaving empty juice cartons in the fridge i cant help myself though every stupid gesture or small task they could have done themselves is a wrongheaded expression of how much i love them and how few outlets i still have to show it there has been an unexpected sweetness and simplicity to this stolen covid time the extra year with them i had no right to we have had time to talk and i have learned more from them than the other way around about tcells quantum mechanics lee krasner and the carbon footprint of fishing no more fishfingers their generation is kinder and more accepting than mine and im learning from that too why my son probes curiously am i uncomfortable around people with high selfworth why so cynical of peoples motives so suspicious of sincerity and positivity when i stop tidying for five minutes and just enjoy their company i can see a future where my relationship with them is not defined by these unsolicited acts of domestic servitude this is a time of letting go of stepping away from the washing machine and relating to my sons as the adults they are becoming and im starting to see how letting go could be wonderful,2021-03,son wa youngers birthday week made awful cake

today the observer launches a campaign to tackle femicide defined as the killing of a woman by a man we are working in conjunction with karen ingala smith and clarrie ocallaghan creators of the unique femicide census annually the census details and analyses the deaths of all women at the hands of men in the uk in november for the first time the census published a year study in this campaign we are drawing on its unique database the title of the year report was if im not in on friday i might be dead the words of judith nibbs who was beheaded by her husband of years dempsey nibbs a woman was killed every three days throughout the decade domestic abuse costs bn a year in england and wales since recorded domestic abuserelated crimes have increased by we have yet to learn the full impact of the pandemic last week the government promised an extra m to tackle violence against women and girls thats risible womens aid has calculated that m is required to provide sustainable services however as tomorrow is international womens day first there are achievements to applaud the results of years of campaigning by feminists and the womens sector of course men are also victims but that is not this campaigns focus the domestic abuse bill may soon become law among its measures are a new statutory definition of domestic abuse that includes economic abuse other measures outlaw nonfatal strangulation the rough sex defence and postseparation abuse it is hoped the bill will apply to migrant women without recourse to public funds currently excluded the appointment of the very able nicole jacobs as the first domestic abuse commissioner should also drive change in the uk at least million people experience domestic abuse every year the overwhelming majority will not see justice in the courts womenonly specialist services in the community are vital yet they have seen funding drastically cut it is imperative that the bill places a statutory duty on local authorities to fund these organisations and refuges femicide is about domestic abuse but it also refers to women who die outside the domestic sphere they are victims of strangers friends burglars and handymen the femicide census counted women out of the total of in this category they make up one of the main focuses of the three overarching aims of the observers femicide campaign name it know it stop it why name it the british government is reluctant to employ the word femicide in for instance its response to a un document on femicide failed to directly mention it the impending new strategy on violence against women and girls must not be so reticent it matters because we need government to ask for instance what are the commonalities and differences between men who commit sexually motivated murders of older women and those who kill girlfriends as karen ingala smith says to solve a problem you need to be able to say what it is why know it as todays investigation of the killings of older women shows we know too little yet the evidence is in plain sight waiting to be gathered data collection is vital we need information on ethnicity and race of victims and perpetrators proper recording of sexual violence and better identification of hidden homicides including suspicious falls suicides and drugrelated deaths domestic homicide reviews dhrs bring all agencies together that have had contact with the victim and the perpetrator to analyse what went wrong and make recommendations to prevent errors recurring a dhr home office study noted the repetition of recommendations they include the need for better record keeping risk assessment and collaboration between agencies and specialist training for health professionals including gps as professor khatidja chantler of manchester metropolitan university who has analysed dhrs asks who is monitoring whether these recommendations are being implemented and how well when lessons are not learned women are killed jacobs and the centre for womens justice are rightly fighting for a properly funded national femicide oversight mechanism this would include a central repository of dhrs and all other inquiries relating to femicides including coroners reports the domestic abuse and victims commissioners also need the resources and staff to detect when recommendations are not implemented so action can be taken to prevent future deaths finally stop it requires an ambitious strategy directed at sex discrimination misogyny and attitudes that blame the victim it requires more research on what might make abusive men desist mental health addiction abuse in childhood attitudes to women and beliefs about masculinity all contribute to men becoming controlling and violent to women in addition the tools to assess risk prompt concern they are better suited to younger than older women as the excellent work by charlotte barlow and sandra walklate of lancaster and liverpool universities shows coercive control is a pervasive pattern of abuse while the risk tools used by police give more importance to physical violence what counts as risk has to be improved the national police chiefs council says that training on coercive control is being improved but police also need more resources and time name it know it stop it the pandemic has kept a spotlight on domestic abuse and femicide for an unprecedented entire year we can no longer turn away if

nine years ago i gave birth to a little girl and now that little girl has grown into a bookworm it began as all stories about books should really begin in a bookshop i was several months pregnant and i picked up an american picture book i had never come across before goodnight moon by margaret wise brown it featured a poem that my husband and i would end up reading oh i dont know at least times the book became such a pillar of my daughters nightly routine that by the time she could talk i realised she knew it by heart it also marked a turning point for me i had been finding the pregnancy hard various complications meant it was high risk and there was a good chance i would not manage to carry my baby to term this knowledge weighed heavily in my heart while in my womb flora was literally doing somersaults for the sonographers happily oblivious to my concerns with every kick i could feel her growing stronger and stronger but i was still avoiding buying anything for her it was so painful my constant fear that i would lose her i couldnt face it each day so i tried not to think about it that meant i could not allow myself to imagine being a mum buying something for her felt too bold as though i was assuming the pregnancy would be all right that the birth would be fine that she would be ok and back then that felt too scary like i was tempting fate but that book goodnight moon it got me it is a poem published in which stars a bunny who says goodnight to everything in the room and i mean literally everything that can be seen or heard the stars the air a comb a brush a quiet old lady whispering hush when i read it it took me back to a longforgotten sense of myself as a child that is how strongly the narrators voice seemed to me to come from the childs perspective the page that i fell in love with the page that made me buy that book despite all my fears about my pregnancy is the blank empty page towards the end that is when unexpectedly the poet turns to the emptiness and cheerfully says goodnight nobody like its perfectly normal to wish an empty page goodnight on the opposite page there is a bowl of porridge and the words goodnight mush the silliness and playfulness of that made me laugh out loud this was a book i wanted to have in my possession a book i knew i would love sharing with a child of my own and suddenly i could imagine myself reading it to her the child i was carrying the little baby who one day i would get to meet so i carried the little book gingerly to the till it was the first real purchase i made for flora and the first time i allowed myself to believe she would be born a few months later she came hurtling into the world small but healthy and miraculously only a couple of weeks before her due date and goodnight moon was waiting for her i had become convinced after reading in some selfhelp pregnancy book or other that following a nighttime routine was essential if you wanted the baby to go to sleep easily and of course as a firsttime mum i believed this without question goodnight moon i decided would be part of that nightly routine it would be the final book my husband and i would read to her each night the book that signalled we were about to say goodnight to her and turn off the light with a book so powerful to help us put a baby to sleep how could we possibly fail and so i began my relationship with my daughter with that book glued to my side like it was some kind of a talisman as a result my poor longsuffering husband and i ended up reading goodnight moon to her so many times we could still recite it by heart for years afterwards as well as at bedtime we even started reading it to her before we put her down for a nap it was as if i thought that book could cast some kind of magic spell on babies and on flora in particular that it would miraculously bring her closer to sleep with every goodnight uttered by that funny little bunny of course it did nothing of the sort she rarely went to sleep easily and it was well over a year before she slept through the night but in unintended ways my weird obsession with goodnight moon really paid off it meant almost without fail we read to her each evening and before naptime during the day whenever we desperately wanted her to go to sleep that imposed a reading routine on the structure of her day very early on and as her attention span increased so did our library of little board books soon we were reading three four five or six books to her two or three times a day it wasnt always easy and i wont deny that it felt odd at first reading so often to such a young baby but there is strong evidence that reading to children when they are infants can have a positive impact on their language literacy and early reading skills years later on when theyre about to begin primary school according to booktrust its never too early to start sharing books with a baby they might not understand the words but they will love cuddling up hearing your voice and looking at the pictures this is a very important point because for me reading to flora was never just about the literacy benefits it was also about the bonding reading books to my baby made me feel much closer to her in among all the frantic activity of those first six to months the rushing around to baby classes the interminable walks around the park while she slept in the pram the whirlwind of visits from friends and family the time we spent reading together became a quiet time i could look forward to each day a time when i could sit down relax and share my love of books with my child a special time when it was just the two of us and i didnt have to be in mum mode feeding her or dressing her or changing her nappy i could just be me a book lover and we could just enjoy being there together in the moment i began to take huge amounts of pleasure in reading aloud to her something you rarely get to do in other circumstances as an adult at last i realised i had a captive audience who did not have the physical capacity to run away when i used my silliest and most dramatic reading voices to this end i sought out board books that would really allow me to go to town and express myself my favourite by far was the noisy book by the french author and illustrator soledad bravi this book recommended by the booktrust for reading to ages zero and up has a simple structure each page shows a cartoon of a creature or object and the writing opposite tells you what sound to make the cracker goes boom the blocks go clackety clack the cold goes achoo in total there are different examples of funny sounds to make and its up to you the narrator to choose the volume and convey the passion and sound of each noise there are funny little surprises in the middle the snail does nothing but move its elegant feelers and it ends delightfully with a kiss that goes mwah i loved that book so much instead of grabbing a moment to myself i would often sit and listen to my husband read it to her giggling at his version of a donkeys heehaw or a frogs ribbet i admired the way that the book changed with every narrator who read it that you could really inject your personality in the words and have fun with the sounds it brought out my own inner child reading this book made me realise that my top priority when reading to flora should be to choose books that would be fun to read and i do mean fun for me to read i believed that if i enjoyed reading to her flora would inevitably start to enjoy it too she is nine years old now and an avid book reader and every day i thank my lucky stars that she is in my life and that we both love books,2021-03,nine year ago gave birth little girl little girl ha grown bookworm began story book really begin bookshop wa

joeli brearley was sacked by voicemail the day after she told her boss she was pregnant it was and she was working for a charity i immediately thought the law will protect me she recalls but i was also terrified because i had bills to pay and i thought nobodys going to employ me now seething at the injustice she wanted to take the company to court but hers was a highrisk pregnancy and she had to pull out after doctors told her that stress would probably trigger an early labour instead she set up the organisation pregnant then screwed to fight for others who had experienced similar discrimination take the woman who was told her promotion was a done deal and she just had to do an interview as a formality just before the interview she told her boss she was pregnant suddenly the new job wasnt open to her or the woman who was bullied so mercilessly at work after she announced her pregnancy that she went into premature labour as she sat in the neonatal clinic with her baby who almost died her boss called and made her role redundant in a normal year the legal advice line run by pregnant then screwed receives about calls from women experiencing pregnancy and maternity discrimination at work since the start of the pandemic weve given women free legal advice in some form says brearley who has written a book pregnant then screwed the truth about the motherhood penalty and how to fix it companies she believes are taking advantage of the pandemic to remove pregnant women and mothers a survey of nearly mothers and pregnant women carried out by pregnant then screwed found that of them had been made redundant or expected to be this is a generational rollback says brearley fifteen per cent of mothers leaving the workforce is enormous it took us years to increase maternal employment by just it isnt just women worried about their livelihoods that the organisation has been speaking to but pregnant women who are terrified and worried about their safety and are being asked to work in dangerous situations where they could contract covid in may last year pregnant then screwed conducted research with nearly pregnant workers and found that a quarter of those working in the nhs were caring for covid patients among bame women it was nearly a third mothers are also more likely than fathers to be put on furlough to look after children they are more likely to have left their jobs or reduced their hours and to do more childcare and housework pregnant then screwed also claims selfemployed women who had taken maternity leave were discriminated against in the governments covid support package although it lost its legal challenge over this last month the pandemic has only amplified the longterm discrimination experienced by pregnant women and mothers the gender pay gap is driven largely by motherhood in the equality and human rights commission found that pregnant women are forced out of their jobs each year about one in nine working pregnant women there are very few consequences for employers brearley says that just take their employers to a tribunal there is a time limit a claim must be made within three months how many pregnant women or those with a new baby can face going through that brearley didnt even have the option of a tribunal because she wasnt on staff at the charity but rather selfemployed and working under contract she would have had to use the more expensive and onerous court system i was left with the choice of accessing justice or the health of my unborn child had i continued with the case and the baby had died i would never have forgiven myself i had to drop it she felt livid she says she has heard hundreds of vicious horrific experiences that torment women for years and their mental health deteriorates weve had women on our advice lines who are suicidal as a result of discrimination and women who have ended up homeless or have been told to have an abortion when youre at your most vulnerable and somebody gives you that extra punch it lasts for a very long time after her son was born brearley got another better job but she couldnt let go i thought i cant allow this to eat away at me every day ive got to do something to change the situation she launched pregnant then screwed in originally as a platform to tell womens stories but she soon discovered it was difficult to get women to speak even anonymously if they still had jobs they were worried their employers would see it brearley also found that many women had been gagged with nondisclosure agreements ndas in settling pregnancy discrimination claims i have in my head a list of companies who win awards for gender equality and are held up as these beacons and i know that behind closed doors when a woman gets pregnant they kick her out of her job says brearley and on the way out they make her sign an nda so she cant speak publicly about it expect to see many of them putting out messages of empowerment on social media to mark international womens day next week it is so frustrating knowing what is actually going on all this discrimination that is completely covered up for some women an nda has benefits they may feel the anonymity protects their professional reputation and they dont want to become known as a troublemaker what brearley would love she says with a smile when we speak over a video call her two sons are being looked after by her partner in another room is to see every woman whos signed an nda to break it on the same day and say what really has been going on but you cant force people to do that pregnant then screwed has grown it is now brearleys fulltime job and offers legal advice and mentorship to support women going through tribunals undertakes research and campaigns to improve conditions for pregnant women and mothers it seems like a gigantic task not just to change legislation but to encourage a complete overhaul of society and gender stereotypes still brearley is convinced it can be done if there is a positive to the pandemic she says it may be that many fathers have had the opportunity to spend more time with their children and many of them will be requesting flexible working and although women have still done the bulk of the unpaid labour among heterosexual couples men have taken on more than before and had their eyes opened to the reality of it introducing paid leave for fathers a useorlose policy rather than one that can be shared would help mothers go back to work and set the tone for more equal caring responsibilities men are also hampered by stigma of fathers say they want to spend more time with their children but the perception is that they then arent committed to their work she knows of one father on paternity leave who would receive emails from his boss that started hello nanny childcare should be considered essential infrastructure she says care is seen as the soft option people dont really believe that an investment in care is good for the economy instead the focus particularly in getting us out of this current economic crisis is on an industrial strategy but the research shows that an investment in care creates times the number of jobs as equivalent investment in build build build which is what the government has gone for also we know that wellfunctioning societies value care and capitalism equally the uk has as a proportion of household income the most expensive childcare in the world which makes going back to work financially unviable for many mothers in sweden for instance where childcare is heavily subsidised it costs parents up to of household income instead of the uks average of about the womens budget group an independent organisation that analyses how government policies affect women estimates that up to of the cost of free universal preschool childcare could be recouped from the increase in employment and jobcreation and reduced benefits highquality earlyyears education is also linked to better life chances for children there is little appetite for properly funded childcare because people dont understand the economic benefits says brearley and it is an expensive initial outlay you recoup that further down the line but governments think short term rather than long term another important change she says would be a widespread adoption of a fourday working week or at least increased flexibility we have such an obsession with presenteeism in the uk and yet in terms of our productivity were rubbish in a workplace that values people at desks people who leave on time particularly to pick a child up from an afterschool club or childcare cant compete so why are the needs of working mothers routinely ignored all i can think is that the government just doesnt see it as a priority it just does not believe that its important that mothers have access to the workplace but it makes absolutely no sense because it benefits the economy much of this she says is down to basic sexism according to the british social attitudes survey one in five people think women with children under school age should stay at home in a collection of essays boris johnson wrote that women had been incentivised into the workplace as if they shouldnt want to work and that children of lowincome working mothers were more likely to mug you brearley says there are deeply entrenched gender stereotypes that mean women blame themselves when they get pregnant and get pushed out of their jobs they think theyre the burden they believe that narrative but the government certainly doesnt help change that there is the enduring idea that having children is a lifestyle choice as opposed to raising the next generation of people who will keep society going i like the idea of women going on strike id love to see it agrees brearley women in iceland held a national day off in i love that they sold out of sausages because that was the easy ready meal of the day and the men still call it the long friday it was obviously impactful and made an enormous difference iceland although not perfect is consistently considered the best place to be a woman i just dont think wed be able to pull it off in the uk still she thinks that there is a lot of anger about the decisions that have been taken during the pandemic and hopes this will force change at least when the schools reopen and when surviving another day with everyone fed clothed and maybe even home schooled doesnt feel like the pinnacle of achievement mothers are livid going by the women that i speak to i feel absolutely furious that weve not been

this week we will celebrate our babys first birthday one year one odd old fallen tree of a year instead of having gone by like normal months they toppled slowly and now lie in pieces by our feet the baby was helpful as we had markers of time having passed the baby laughed time has passed the baby crawled time has passed the baby is eating an egg time has passed because without him it would have been so very possible for me to have stared at this same framed photograph on my wall this same scrolling little screen and be tricked into believing it was still september or tuesday or midnight without the baby growing first inside and then beside me as physical proof of time i could not have seen this year as anything but metaphor it was not a year it was that fallen tree this melting candle an elastic band stretched very tight it was weetabix decaying in its unspooned milk so well celebrate in our way do i sound weary i am a bit i am a bit weary i keep having to reinject my upper arm with the reminder that life is changing again and hope is here etc chivvy myself along by planning decadent orgies and similar looking at photos of beaches reading exhibition calendars of faraway galleries oh the places ill go when i returned from maternity leave ill admit i was nervous about writing a column again i was averaging one opinion a month and it was rarely correct and often gloomy i had done nothing i had been nowhere i had slept little i reentered the virtual workplace six months after everybody else had had a headstart in acclimatising to what they were coolly calling the new normal i was worried there would be nothing new to say all the pain i thought had already been expressed all the boredom all the jokes had been told the one about zoom backgrounds and how nobody wears bras any more and all the endless grim asides about bread but it turned out happily that there was plenty more to say even when the world was on hold it was possible to kick over another stone and find more revolting new truths scurrying from the light except ive had enough of stones now and while i would wholeheartedly recommend having a healthy baby as a distraction from any future pandemics write this down somewhere tape it to the fridge it brings with it something also bittersweet and bruising having a whole new child to measure how very very long we have been enduring this gloaming microlife is chastening we tick off his developments in our head at the same time tallying all hes missed all the relatives whove yet to hold him all the places hes never been all my friends new babies he hasnt accidentally wounded with his large strong head the week of our babys birthday was also the first anniversary of my boyfriends beloved grandma dying she just missed him when jewish people die theres a stonesetting ceremony a year later and because of lockdown this was the first chance my boyfriend had to mourn to go to essex and see the grave and listen to a prayer he returned with blueish skin and a quiet admission that walking through the cemetery he saw the plots first of a stiffman then of a klot and became distracted by how many stones appeared to not only name the person but also describe the manner of death six of his family stood there in the wind and said goodbye to his grandma and then to each other getting back into their own cars to follow their satnavs home and its not the same as his grans stone setting our babys first birthday party its not but also it is a bit it is a bit because a year ago we could neither have a funeral for her nor a celebration for him when we returned home from the hospital nobody was allowed to come and bring us lasagnes for the freezer or very tiny hats and nobody was allowed to sit together when she died or hug or fret about whether there were enough bagels back at the house both events had the loneliness baked in and still even a whole year a whole boy later normality still requires quote marks we will celebrate in a way rather than the festival of friends and screaming kids and high chance of vomit we have come to know from his sisters birthday parties the babys birthday will be if not mournful exactly then at least sedate a series of timed garden visits from select family members an inevitable conversation about whether or not candles should be blown and if so in what direction still there will be three cakes the promise of sun and a visit from a puppy i pinch my arm not to test if im dreaming because this is clearly neither nightmare nor waking life but something else swampy and entropic but to reinject hope pinch breathe cut the second cake life is changing again and hope is here etc email eva at ewisemanobservercouk or follow her on twitter evawiseman,2021-04,week celebrate

im not sure what qualifies as a spate is there official guidance but there has been a spateadjacent number of incidents of teenagers getting stuck in baby swings in york recently solemnly reported in the local paper the fire brigade released the teenager and gave advice says one report the advice presumably being do not sit in a baby swing im delighted by these incidents and what they represent teenagers being teenagers and doing stupid stuff there are neurological explanations for teenage silliness the late maturing of the connections between the prefrontal cortex involved in regulating decisionmaking and selfcontrol and other parts of the brain skews their perception of risk sometimes that means eating detergent pods ducttaping a friend to a tree or worse more often it involves the kind of cheery universal daftness typified by wedging yourself into a tiny swing the reemergence of teenagers lounging around childrens play areas treading on municipal tulips mock or not mock fighting and abandoning their cans has prompted a panicked surge of disapproval they are using foul language and causing a nuisance and gathering in groups of more than six people tut swerving to avoid them the neighbourhood app nextdoor is full of complaints about youths causing absolute mayhem as one user put it let he or she who has not spun a mate dangerously fast on a roundabout for infants cast the first stone ask almost anyone about their teenage antics and they will get mistyeyed we all recall sledging down vertiginous slopes on car parts or pushing each other into rivers i was a pretty tame teen but i would climb any railing however high and deadly my husband had a moped enough said really this lot have had no opportunity to do anything silly for most of the past year they have been stultifyingly admirably responsible and their reward is a cold shower of adult disapproval they might be annoying but im thrilled to see them getting wedged in street furniture nature

in nursery my son is a different boy altogether we know this because they send us pictures via a little website which is fast becoming our favourite internet destination it collects images and occasionally videos of his time in nursery usually paired with behavioural advances or feast days for st patricks day we saw him in full ireland rugby kit making shamrocks out of playdoh at easter he painted eggs on world book day he was kitted out like a fox because it was the only vaguely bookrelated outfit we had to hand you may remember it also served as his outfit for two halloween gatherings and an animalthemed playdate we keep meaning to get him something else because its fur is so thick hes reduced to a sweaty mess within minutes of use but we always forget at this rate hell be getting married in it in nursery he leads the life of a boarder at a swiss governing school for the children of bond villains at home he turns his nose up at any but his favourite dinners there he eats baba ghanoush and real grains and tuna tuna we cant even get him to eat fish fingers his interest in crafts goes beyond painting dinosaurs or his own hands and extends to constructing byzantine structures from clingfilm and acrylic paints perhaps he thinks of us as the peasant guardians of some tortured sophisticate he puts up with our provincial ways at home only to recast himself as a renaissance man in nursery there he speaks latin studies architecture and im fairly sure he smokes a pipe theres something very touching about seeing him interact with his little friends without the selfconsciousness that seeps in when were around and its weirdly affecting to see him so independent and attentive affecting and occasionally alarming going through the website is sometimes like perusing a catalogue of different better behaviours for our son such good manners we say slightly annoyed my son is in short what my father might have termed a street angel home divil a term he used for us when we acted nice as pie in public but turned stroppy and possibly even criminal at home id have thought the term fairly common in the ireland of my youth but realise now i only ever heard my dad say it googling it only shows its use in american writing on narcissistic personality disorder which perhaps suggests my fathers opinion of us back then he never had the luxury of weekly photo updates of the goingson in my infant life im not sure he would have cherished it to be honest we on the other hand cant live without our glimpse at his daily life even if it does reveal the first heartstabs of his burgeoning

i love slide cries my son with greater emotion than he has ever mustered for me the man who has fed and clothed him since birth not to mention facilitated of every slide interaction hes ever had were at the playground not big playground which is what we call the sprawling byzantine ludoplex in the larger park minutes away that has six slides eight swings and little wooden forts no this is little playground the smaller more local one its not my sons favourite but we like it because its less busy which means he can use anything he wants and i dont have to talk to as many other parents please understand my problem is not with them but my own newfound inability to make small talk i revert to platitudes of such serene blandness i hate myself as im saying them he just loves this slide i say to the mum beside me as my son uses the slide he loves she laughs and agrees which is actually mad because her daughter also loves that slide which sets me laughing too because really what are the chances big playground on the other hand teems with people at all times each of whom adult and child alike seems on the edge of an extremely newsworthy nervous breakdown last time i went to big playground there were conservatively million people present and mayhem reigned in all directions here children eating sand while their dads extract anothers head from a climbing frame there a mum begging her now shoeless son to be careful as he goes down a giant metal loopdeloop facefirst with his tongue out its basically a hieronymus bosch painting with swings going there to relax with a child makes about as much sense as going to stansted airport for a coffee we operate under the polite fiction that none of the rules apply to playgrounds which suits me fine nobody wants to see toddlers wearing face masks except that kid with his tongue out but it does give all these interactions a sense of famine and feast we spend most of our lives fastidiously cleaning wiping washing and sterilising and encountering as few people as is legally permissible before breaking this rhythm with occasional halfhour bouts of preschool hedonism its like spending six days a week in a trappist monastery and popping to burning man each sunday sometimes of course little playground is completely deserted which is disconcerting in its own way theres something eerie about an empty playground the ineffable sense that people in hazmat suits may have just finished packing away the police tape minutes before you arrived or that some day a wizened wise old woman will point a spindly finger in our direction and tell us with mounting horror that we must leave this cursed place immediately haha its all right id probably say he just loves this slide follow samas on twitter

fathers should be offered use it or lose it paternity leave lasting at least three months to help challenge the uks entrenched gender roles and the prioritisation of work over family for men according to shadow business secretary ed miliband the former labour leader is advocating for a reordering of responsibilities that gives men the option of spending more time caring for children without financial penalty writing in his forthcoming book miliband says that men who take paternity leave around childbirth develop a closer healthier relationship with their child and that the family unit is stronger our ambition should be to build a world where men engage equally in the caring that has historically been done by women and in so doing reorder the values of work family and love so that work does not always come first he states existing policy he says encourages fathers to take only a brief paternal pit stop because they receive a paltry two weeks paid paternity leave at a flat rate of a week prompting most fathers to cite financial constraints as the biggest barrier to taking more leave with their newly born or adopted child the yearold doncaster mp wants fathers offered nontransferable paid leave at a generous level which he believes would help reframe the men at work women at home dynamic that current uk provision encourages in go big his book about policy ideas that could transform society he cites research that suggests that nine years after a babys birth paternity leave has longterm effects on the quality of fatherchild relationships more equal parental leave would also benefit women in the workplace and help narrow the gender pay gap which research shows can be attributed to childcare although milibands views arent official labour policy there appears to be considerable appetite within the party to promote gender equality on saturday details emerged of how labour would make it illegal to make women redundant during pregnancy while calling on the government to review its failing parental leave policy miliband writes we would start to break free from a culture which loads so much on to women penalises them for having children constrains them in a particular stereotype if we get this right everyone can contribute to economic success and acquire more choice about how they balance work and family life it could be the start of a remaking of the social contract between women and men and between work and family life added miliband who recently confessed he wasnt bold enough when trying to convince the british electorate in that he should be prime minister groups representing fathers rights welcomed milibands intervention in the debate michael lewkowicz spokesperson for the charity families need fathers said we fully support an extension of paid paternity leave we believe both parents matter in childrens lives and research evidence supports this our policies are out of date and dont support the best interests of children or

labour would make it illegal to make women redundant during pregnancy and for six months after their return to work as part of a slew of policies to protect and promote gender equality in the recovery from the pandemic the party also called on the government to review the uks failing shared parental leave policy and to introducing ethnicity pay gap reporting it has also pledged to modernise equal pay laws to give women the right to know what their male colleagues earn labour is calling for the government to disclose the number of jobs that have been created by schemes such as kickstart restart and jets by sex ethnicity and disability the move will put pressure on the government to do more to boost equality in the workforce and protect pregnant workers as the end of the furlough scheme draws closer experts have warned that women who often dominate the industries hardest hit by covid are at particular risk when the furlough scheme ends in september with the office for budget responsibility warning that sectors dominated by women are likely to face the slowest recoveries as of march women were on furlough compared with men according to government figures while in may last year the institute for fiscal studies found that mothers were one and a half times more likely than fathers to have either lost their job or quit since the lockdown began with saturday marking the st anniversary of the equal pay act marsha de cordova the shadow women and equalities secretary said urgent action was needed to prevent a twotier recovery from the pandemic labour want to see data on the number of jobs created the impact of the pandemic on the gender and ethnicity pay gaps and an urgent review of the failing shared parental leave system she said making it illegal to make a new mother redundant during pregnancy and maternity leave except in very specific circumstances is a simple robust way to end discrimination the charity maternity action welcomed the move saying government ministers had been promising reform since january after research by the equality and human rights commission found widespread noncompliance by employers the study found that of mothers working women lost their job as a result of maternity discrimination each year it was shocking that the government had not taken action to address the gendered impact of the covid pandemic identified by the women and equalities select committee said ros bragg director of maternity action with the shelving of the repeatedly promised employment bill and with women facing a wave of unfair redundancies as the furlough scheme winds down this summer women need action now she said the charity also accused the government of falsely claiming that it had made reforms to redundancy policy to prevent discrimination in the conservative manifesto which stated we have reformed redundancy law so companies cannot discriminate against women immediately after returning from maternity leave bragg said there was no evidence to support this a government spokesperson said pregnancy and maternity discrimination is unlawful and has no place in the workplace which is why we have already announced plans to extend the redundancy protection period afforded to mothers on maternity leave our plans will extend the existing redundancy protections to pregnant women and for six months after a mother

by the time her baby was four months old zara a psychologist and executive coach from surrey was able to open a bottle of wine and have a bit of an evening he was sleeping in fourhour stints waking twice in the night then at four and half months his sleep pattern changed it was five wakes then six then eight zara says she was so exhausted she ended up googling can you die from sleep deprivation i was broken emotional confused sleepdeprived and catastrophising she says he wouldnt be down for longer than minutes and i was losing my mind using a sleep consultant was the best money ive ever spent to give me the confidence to trust my child to get himself to sleep without me another mother from surrey heike who works for a beauty brand enlisted the help of the same sleep consultant but couldnt have had a more different experience i was so disappointed shocked really i was left feeling a complete failure but also very angry and lost she says when you dig into the world of sleep consultants its a familiar story some like zara see them as guardian angels others are left feeling judged criticised and as if theyve wasted their money the industry is burgeoning though thanks to wordofmouth recommendations at antenatal groups and via the social media accounts of experts filled with images of angelic babies sleeping soundly understandably tempting to any parent sitting up with a wideeyed screaming baby night after night according to the website of the london school of childcare studies lscs which runs a sleep practitioner course its an unregulated industry and qualifications are not required to start working although they state that most parents would be more comfortable employing someone appropriately qualified the lscs offers a short course about weeks comprising six weekly sessions in person followed by another six of assisted selfstudy although during the pandemic training has been mainly online for rosey davidson founder of just chill baby sleep is one of the biggest success stories with instagram followers her linkedin page mentions her lscs qualification however many highprofile sleep consultants focus more on their experience working as nannies or maternity nurses and raising their own children like most sleep consultants davidson has a social media feed full of tips videos and inspirational quotes she offers a range of services from basic resources for an online foundations of sleep course to more expensive comprehensive programmes for a twoweek personalised plan similar online courses from the night ninja or care it out cost less than but the higherlevel services in which a parent might get a personal consultation a plan and four weeks of support may charge as much as everyone in the world of sleep medicine is aware of sleep consultants says dr dimitri gavriloff who runs the paediatric nonrespiratory sleep disorders service at oxford university hospitals often they have a semiclinical background a nurse or someone who has worked in healthcare and theyre keen to do something to improve the health and wellbeing of children and their parents so we start from a really positive perspective there are however people who are less wellinformed as this is a period where parents are particularly anxious capitalising on that can be potentially negative gavriloff points out that sleep is vital to the physical and mental health of both parents and children you want someone who is appropriately trained using evidencebased intervention in a way that is not exploitative this vulnerability is something heike picks up on i was insecure and vulnerable when we reached out and the consultant made me feel so guilty as if i hadnt done my job as a mum annabelle a writer from gloucestershire had a similar reaction our time working with a sleep consultant was one of the hardest of my life i felt as if she didnt understand my sons sleep issues and she kept repeating the same advice without listening to me it all came down to letting the baby protest ie cry and not picking up rocking or feeding him that meant being up with him for hours through the night he would just stand in his cot and cry it wasnt sustainable the pressure was so intense i was crying all the time one night it took me three hours to get my son to sleep i contacted her the next morning and she told me i was obviously doing something to overstimulate him heike found her sleep consultant rigid and critical she questioned everything we did from the music we played to the lavender scent we used in the diffuser to our babys toys gavriloff is clear if you have someone who is vulnerable and desperate you dont go in there in a punitive fashion with shoulds and should nots support should be compassionate understanding and well informed lindsey from bristol who runs her own hr business enlisted a sleep consultant when her daughter was four months i was feeling a little out of my depth with two children under four especially if i was alone at bedtime to put them both down she says lindsey says her consultant came over before the pandemic for an hour to discuss their routine and highlighted areas for improvement i was bathing them every other night blaming her sensitive skin but in reality i just found it hard bathing two together the consultant told me to buy a sitin bath seat for my baby so i didnt have to worry about her slipping or getting knocked by her big brother she called us out in a nice way it gave me the reassurance and confidence i needed interrupted baby and infant sleep isnt always a problem it can be a normal part of development maybe of infants and toddlers will have the symptoms of insomnia disorder which is repeated night wakings or needing to be rocked or suckled to sleep gavriloff says do some parents unwittingly encourage problems he is at pains to be sympathetic theres nothing worse than feeling crap as a parent its an awful place to be emotionally and it changes the relationship you have with your child but its absolutely possible to overcome sleep problems parents have an important role to play in child sleep some children are able to selfsoothe innately but in many children its a learned behaviour gavriloff says explaining that if parents routinely put their child to sleep by rocking or feeding them the child develops a sleep onset association its helpful to associate sleep with a quiet room a soft duvet a teddy bear these are able to facilitate sleep onset independently negative associations are feeding or rocking a baby to sleep singing them a particular lullaby or rubbing their back theyre really common and theyre not a sign of anything pathological per se the point at which it becomes a clinical issue is when it becomes a problem for people if the child or the parents arent getting enough sleep one of the most controversial aspects of sleep training is the cryitout method where babies are left to cry for certain lengths of time ranging from one minute to many people will have first heard of this technique also described as controlled crying in via gina fords bestselling the contented little baby book while some see it as a parenting bible others feel training a child this way is distressing and impossible the topic has proved so contentious that in ford sued parenting website mumsnet for defamatory comments about her comments were removed and the case was settled out of court unsurprisingly many modern sleep trainers say they avoid the cryitout approach but all the mothers i speak to for this article say that ultimately they were encouraged to try it i was assured that cry training wasnt the only method the sleep consultant used but it was heike says she had expressed her desire not to use that method saying we wanted to tend to our baby annabel echoes this the one method suits all of letting the baby protest just didnt suit us my personal view is that the only reason it works is because the baby doesnt cry because they know nobody will come for them lindsey had a different experience my daughter had a story she went down with a soft teddy under her arm near her cheek id say goodnight and leave the room even if she was crying and wait outside if the crying ramped up and she sounded distressed id go in and lay her back down then leave again without talking you repeat that process until they get bored basically we just needed not to buckle evolutionarily crying is an effective mechanism to get you to do something gavriloff says but were not distressing children were making them feel safe enough to fall asleep by themselves he too recommends whats referred to as the extinction method letting a child cry themselves to sleep it sounds awful but its a behavioural term he adds cold turkey would be to put the child to sleep drowsy but awake and leave them until the next morning theres no evidence that leads them to develop a mental health problem later on or that it ruins their attachment style but its very difficult for parents to do he found it too hard with his own daughter so instead he used graded extinction you notice the cues the child is sleepy rubbing their eyes yawning and put them to bed in the same place day or night that develops an association the child will initially cry and what theyre saying is i didnt get the memo on this you then leave the child for a set period it could be one minute or before going back you dont pick them up but you show them that youre there with a neutral or what we might call a robot parent facial expression no anger or distress and no overt effusiveness you leave the room again and wait a set period until you go back in a matter of days or weeks if you stick to these patterns the baby should be able to selfinitiate sleep and when they have brief wakings in the night they will no longer need to be resettled he also explains that sleep regressions are normal usually when theres some kind of developmental milestone theyve learned to pick things up theyre sitting up by themselves or the world has suddenly become more perceptually exciting neurologically he advises not to change the sleep routine and the regression will right itself infants waking every couple of hours is normal too the important thing is whether they can go back to sleep independently he says it may feel exploitative to charge sleepdeprived parents hundreds of pounds but consultants and coaches are clearly answering a need whether youre a medical doctor a psychologist a midwife or a nurse you dont get more than about an hour of training in sleep gavriloff says when people turn to their gp or a health visitor for help theyll probably get something quite succinct he argues that sleep training should be better integrated into antenatal courses paediatric reviews and health visitor appointments a good nights sleep shouldnt be a privilege enjoyed only by the affluent if you cant afford an online programme if you dont have the internet to have a zoom call how can you get the help you need he asks he recommends the book sleeping through the night by jodi a mindell which he says offers more guidance than you will ever get from a sleep consultant his advice to any struggling parent dont beat yourself up this is essentially about being a loving parent choose the right approach for you get everyone on board and take it a day at a time for zara three nights of cryitout saw her baby sleeping through the night while she says listening to him cry felt like an eternity his longest cry was actually five and a half minutes were more and more separated from community parenting theres so much pressure and discussions around sleep feel quite judgmental she says i just wanted to find my own way yawning glory how to tackle childhood sleep problems from tots to teens by dr dimitri gavriloff clinical psychologist and sleep medicine specialist babies and infants create a sleep haven use comfortable bedding and blackout blinds and ensure the room is around c the bedroom should be associated with relaxation and sleep so avoid using it for stimulating activities including timeouts transitional objects such as teddy bears can help a child feel safe and relaxed establish a routine a consistent bedtime routine provides strong behavioural cues follow the same sequence of relaxing activities nightly for example bath pyjamas and teeth story kiss goodnight keep it relatively brief to minutes predictability helps children wind down time it right watch for cues that your child is sleepy rubbing their eyes yawning and use this to guide your timing if youre having to wake your child each morning theyre probably not getting enough give them the confidence to selfsoothe once in the cot keep your involvement to the minimum once theyre able to do this at the start of the night they will stop needing you in the middle of the night too dont give up when youve established an approach stick to it older children and adolescents know their needs developmentally sleep and wake timings often get later during adolescence for many young people this makes both waking up and getting through the day extremely difficult try negotiating bedtimes that are in line with the earliest point at which the young person could fall asleep naturally be sensitive around screens remove tablets tvs and mobile phones which are associated with fun and enjoyment from bedrooms but do it sensitively explain the stimulating effects of technology rather than confiscating devices which feels like a punishment set up useful habits if a young person is unable to fall asleep within minutes it may be more helpful to get up and read quietly somewhere comfortable and dimly lit when sleepiness returns they can get back into bed and try again long periods spent in bed not sleeping can erode a strong bedsleep association and may lead to worry exacerbating the problem if a problem persists despite your best efforts ask your gp for help,2021-05,time baby

when i had my first child the thing that filled me most with dread was television you read that right it wasnt the loss of my independence the prospect of sleepless nights or the fear of what might happen to them in the big bad world rather i was preoccupied with all that tailored to children marketing i knew would make my kids want brightly coloured crap that would capture their attention for about three days sit in a messy toy box for three years then lie in landfill for eternity thankfully the slew of streaming services has saved me from all that advertising i once feared but once every while a toy trend will come at you so forcefully even hiding out in a nuclear bunker wont save you and right now that trend is the fidget pop it i guess it was only a matter of time before someone figured out they could make a less disposable version of bubble wrap sell it to kids and make their parents pay for it but i doubt even that savvy business person could predict how popular fidget pop its would be for those lucky enough to be unfamiliar the fidget pop it is essentially a siliconebased tray of halfsphere bubbles that can be pushed in thrilling kids with the resulting popping sound theyre sold mainly online facebook marketplace amazon ebay aliexpress and the like available in a variety of colours sizes and shapes including the unicorn insert eyeroll emoji here and once a kids done popping one side all they have to do is turn it over to have another go given how many of us have been enthralled by a piece of bubble wrap at least once in our lives the success of this new toy isnt all that surprising but thanks to tiktok and instagram platforms already bewitched by asmr slime videos pop its are a new level of musthave the therapy store owner nick taylor says hes had so much interest from schools businesses and members of the public alike he can hardly meet demand for the toys we have boxes of them disappearing every day and are having to use multiple suppliers to keep them in stock he says in some hands they are just a popular toy but there are some children who may actually really benefit from them that sensory benefit is what makes this toy different from say a lol surprise doll but similar to s toy craze the fidget spinner according to dr katherine isbister professor of computational media at the university of california fidgeting behaviour is quite widespread and the fact that this is becoming more recognised has led to an increase in innovation around products like the pop it that are intentionally designed and marketed to support fidgeting often people just use whats ready to hand a paper clip a usb stick the sleeve from a takeout coffee she explains people say that fidgets help them to pay attention and focus and they also say fidgets can help them calm down or work with feelings like anger children are no exception isbister states that there hasnt been enough scientifically rigorous research into fidget toys yet but she does say that her studies with kids and their caregivers around fidgeting imply that the right kinds of fidgets seem to help kids to focus and manage emotions indeed fidget toys have been available for kids to use for therapeutic purposes for a while now with local and international therapy stores like taylors offering pop its and other similar toys like pop toobs and simpl dimpls isbister is currently working with specialists in childrens socialemotional learning including dr julie schweitzer of university of california davis to do research on the impact of fidget objects on attention for people with adhd she says that some therapists recommend fidget items for people managing adhd with the caveat that these devices dont attract other peoples attention with motion or noise this could explain the rapid rise and demise of the fidget spinner whether the pop it will suffer the same fate as that loud whirring toy remains to be seen theyre certainly quieter this time around i am holding my breath for my own personal reasons though i managed to avoid even the wonder womanthemed fidget spinners four years ago my kid is in year two now and more aware of whats cool read not me so ive caved

my parents were having a dinner party and i was allowed to stay up left unattended in front of the tv this was long before tvondemand when childrens programming aired only on saturday mornings and for a few hours after school and as a result my memory of what i watched is retrievably sharp this was the era of why dont you and danger mouse and going back further prehistoriclooking bagpuss and king rollo all seared into my brain with the force of the novelty that kids tv shows still were my clearest screen memory however aside from an image of mr benn that i assume will outlast all others is those two hours i spent at the age of nine alone in front of psycho ii consensus around graphic sex and violence aside definitions of unsuitable for children change with the times and of course vary hugely according to household my parents were liberal i had no bedtime at weekends and if i stayed very quiet could often stretch out school nights to past pm in the process grabbing minutes of dallas or dynasty these shows were adult only in the technical sense their cartoonishness ruining the feeling you were getting something illicit the news was a bore most comedy was incomprehensible over the course of my childhood i remember only two occasions when my mother bolted from her chair to change channel when a drama about the second world war took a sudden torturey turn and at the sight this mustve been very early channel surely of two men kissing nazis and gays may remain on the banned list for many parents today it is hard for me to discern looking back whether i remember those scenes with such clarity because they were ageinappropriate or because of my mothers response to them although in the case of the gays im pretty sure it was the latter harder still is trying to figure out where to draw the line in my own household now that i have impressionable sixyearolds with their own ipads no matter how many filters i try to set up they have access every time they switch on to images it would have been unthinkable to put before kids years ago the triggers for me arent blood and guts which most kids love and which ive always figured are fine if theyre sufficiently ridiculous i dont mean hellraiser or saw but i did let my kids watch jaws when they were five which they found tedious and scary because of the music and which they soon shoved aside in favour of in their view two vastly superior titles sharknado and headed shark attack more concerning to me is the teen and tween garbage mill that pumps out ostensibly ageappropriate drama and threatens to interfere with the development of selfimage these shows sell a version of empowerment that makes me shudder both my children at one point or another have parroted the phrase believe in yourself which is of course fine on the surface in the context of shows in which to have value that self must be thin pretty straight and popular is chilling however id rather they watched someone lose his legs to a shark than be gaslighted with the ideology that success is solely a function of mindset i have made some mistakes we talk about freak accidents a lot in my house and read a lot of books about natural disasters my kids love a day in pompeii the amazing eightminute video created by an australian animation studio that recreates with violent intensity vesuvius erupting they were early to obsession with the titanic we did a lot of time on the hindenburg i dont know how it came up but one day i found myself telling them the basedonrealevents outline of the movie hours in which james franco spends five nights in the wilderness with his arm stuck under a rock they were totally fascinated you see where this is going i shouldve rewatched the movie which i hadnt seen since its release years ago from memory i thought the bit where he cuts his arm off was seconds i could fast forward through in a movie that was otherwise interesting visually stunning and a useful lesson in not going hiking alone anyway that backfired the buildup was too powerful the implications too scary and although everyone was interested in the technicalities of how one might saw through two bones in ones arm there were nightmares afterwards oops perhaps years from now my children will remember watching hours when they were too young to absorb it but i also assume it wont unduly scar them the day after watching slackjawed as

its the middle of a dark november night and im about to have my first baby but instead of the joyful experience id hoped for i am being rushed into the operating theatre to have an emergency caesarean under general anaesthetic i have a dangerous complication and my sons life is at risk four hours earlier id been sent home by a midwife who told me i couldnt stay in hospital and have an epidural because labour wasnt properly established its a week later and im back home with my son who thankfully made it but im struggling if someone asks me how i am in a kindly voice my voice cracks im spending a lot of time sitting on the bed in a milkstained dressing gown in a few days my partner will go back to work its five years later im tired and hungry and alone with the children who are bickering in the bath it has been a long evening of trying to keep my temper my son whacks his little sister i shout so loud my throat hurts pull him out of the bath and shut him in his room id slipped him a towel but im still overcome with remorse after they go to bed i sink wretchedly into parenting websites searching for reassurance but all i find is cheery zerotolerance tips on positive reinforcement and leading by example too often the inevitable downsides of motherhood are hushed up lest young women are put off yet the scraps of honesty that escape the schoolgates stiff upper lip have always brought me huge relief realism is a political act it builds solidarity and better conditions and this desire to join the dots spurred me to write a manifesto to improve childrearing for all because as a mother i have felt desperately lonely existentially bored and excruciatingly humiliated by glaring strangers on the bus i have clung on panicked to my professional and social identity while tumbling through babyworld and hurtling between the incommensurate time zones of school and work i have felt as if i am failing every single day since my son was born years ago all this despite the fact that i am well resourced and well supported i didnt have fertility treatments or miscarriages or postnatal depression or difficulties breastfeeding and this was all before the pandemic i am also i hasten to add a very happy mother my children have lit up my life i miss them pathetically when they go for a sleepover but the good bits though plentiful dont need affirming the idealisation of motherhood is everywhere in our culture from the gaga coverage of baby royals to the subtly reactionary ideology of contemporary tv even the lesbian workaholic protagonist of the french comedy call my agent renounces her highpowered career to become a stayathome mum in the end motherhood is one of our modern enlightened societys awkward little secrets here we are with more than years of feminism under our belts including years of secondwave feminism during which many consciousnessraising hours were spent unpicking domestic enslavement yet mothers are still underpaid overworked exploited overlooked frazzled isolated and perpetually guilty if anything feminisms longevity compounds the problem the dial hasnt shifted but we want to move on calls for affordable childcare or flexible working are met with stifled yawns the political energy has been sapped before meaningful change has occurred i read articles about the rise of the handson dad yet when i go to a pta coffee morning or a school curriculum meeting mums outnumber dads by to one in the uk half of all mothers develop a mental health problem before or after birth according to the national childbirth trust nct and to experience postnatal depression many researchers believe the prevalence is even higher around of domestic abuse begins in pregnancy suicide is the leading cause of death for mothers during their babys first year research commissioned by the red cross and the coop in found that nearly half of mothers under feel lonely often or all the time feel lonely some of the time fewer than of couples according to a study from university college london split the domestic load let alone the mental load equally most mothers work part time where pay is lower and prospects for promotion are reduced by more than half by the time a womans first child is she is paid on average less than a man according to the institute for fiscal studies becoming a father gives mens earnings a boost some things have got worse this statistical reality is concealed by the rhetoric of feminist progress choice and empowerment at a time when women are supposed to be more liberated than ever before modern motherhood has become rigidly perfectionist support networks of extended families and tightknit communities have fallen away but expectations have been ramped up if mothers really did what nct classes the advice industry and the media recommend they would have children in their s not drink while trying to conceive avoid alcohol caffeine and a host of delicious foods when pregnant and steer clear of diy materials and cleaning products they would choose a natural midwifeled birthing centre and eschew anaesthesia they would breastfeed exclusively and on demand for at least six months they would not sleeptrain their baby they would not work or only very part time during the first three years and they would pay full attention at all times while looking after their children playing with them assiduously and enthusiastically they would never lose their temper nor put them on a time out and they would praise them for good behaviour loudly and continuously this is not a realistic way to live any complaints from mothers about such standards are liable to be read as criticism of their children evidence of bad motherhood or signs of unthinking privilege hence the ubiquitous retort so you think youre the first person to have a baby motherhood has become a curiously politicsfree zone theres no sign of a mothers metoo in a social mediascrutinised globalcompetitive world every aspect of childrens lives must be optimised domestic life has become instagramfiltered privatised and atomised the sunny agora of the mum messageboard thread offers solidarity but also passiveaggressive disapproval mothers today can find themselves cooking three separate dinners while their own mothers would probably have briskly ignored the complaints of fussy eaters then there is the myth that our historic counterparts were selflessly devoted to their offspring and that things only changed when women entered employment or further education think of the tuttutting about the shift from home cooking to ready meals of course historical records reveal this morality tale to be false before the th century children were sent out to wetnurses parked in prams in the street watched by older children or neighbours or put to work mothers in a number of western countries today spend more time looking after their kids than they did years ago children were also taken to work on the backs of agricultural workers or placed in a basket hung from a nail in factories working from home was commonplace for women and men yet combining family with a job is now a daily struggle for every mother i know and public attitudes are if anything more punitive and sexist in the extensive media coverage of recent novels exploring uneasy relationships between working mothers and their nannies there is a howling silence about the fathers from the early th century feminists have championed the right to avoid having children yet somehow advances in fertility technology have only reinforced the assumption that motherhood is an essential part of being a woman and as couples worldwide are having fewer children each child becomes freighted with concern the biological clock can tick just as loudly for women who have been led to believe they can be whoever they want to be meanwhile their male peers seem less disposed than ever to settling down parenting in the past was a more varied and often more relaxed affair never hug and kiss them never let them sit in your lap advised the american behaviourist john watson in his childcare guide if you havent a nurse and cant leave the child put it out in the backyard a large part of the day build a fence around the yard so that you are sure no harm can come to it if you must watch the child make yourself a peephole so that you can see it without being seen or use a periscope im not suggesting we revive the periscope but this approach does shed a forgiving light on todays exacting standards and presumptions of maternal decrepitude in her polemic the mind of a child the teacher and suffragette ennis richmond cheerfully admitted that she could only stand an hour or two of being on all fours rumpled and dragged at and deafened in fact it was not until later in the th century that popular parenting experts believed mothers should play with their children as both duty and instinctual pleasure before then it was considered harmfully overstimulating in a pamphlet the emergence of fun morality the american psychologist martha wolfenstein objected to how governmentissued childcare literature was mandating reluctant mothers to make play an aspect of every activity losing your temper to which no human being is immune is universally frownedupon with a handful of exceptions philippa perrys the book you wish your parents had read usefully decodes the buttonpushing modern parenting advice reinforced by absolutist extrapolations from research on the infant brain is dauntingly strict towards mothers even if youre at your wits end you must always as the american psychologist and life coach suzanne gelb told her readers in her childrearing manual it starts with you be your best by contrast earlier critics recognised maternal ambivalence in all goodenough mothers in a remarkable essay the paediatrician and psychoanalyst donald winnicott explained that of course every mother hates her infant from the word go after all he treats her as scum an unpaid servant a slave his love for her is cupboard love so that having got what he wants he throws her away like orange peel in the second sex simone de beauvoir pointed in fact to the dangers of selfsacrifice mothers who try to be good all the time give up all pleasure all personal life enabling them to assume the role of victim she wrote in their displays of resignation spur guilt feelings in the child which are more harmful than aggressive displays of course there has been progress too hospital birth in the early th century was no picnic and modern parenting experts have increased childrens safety and wellbeing medical advances have revolutionised maternal and infant life chances but in too many areas the clock has run backwards take the modern cult of natural motherhood in the early th century firstwave feminists lobbied for wider access to pain relief in childbirth with official support the sufferings of women noted a s government committee are a question of great national importance the writer and activist shulamith firestone was more blunt pregnancy she wrote in the dialectic of sex in was barbaric childbirth was like shitting a pumpkin yet over the past decade epidural use has fallen in the uk by according to an nhs report while this may be a good choice for some women a pain relieffree birth is now being held up as a badge of honour hours labour and all natural crowed the mail online after the birth of gorgeous george the duchess of cambridge gave birth without recourse to any powerful painkillers when katie goodland fiancee of footballer harry kane used the hypnobirthing technique during her labour in kane tweeted that he was so proud of her for having the most amazing water birth with no pain relief at all this time there was at least some pushback kane insisted in response that any women can give birth however they would like it is certainly interesting that in an era when technologydriven convenience is privileged in every other realm natural birth and natural motherhood an intensive style of parenting which involves extended breastfeeding cosleeping washable nappies and organic homemade purees are on the rise naturally they have become huge industries too with a proliferation of hypnobirthing classes and selfcare products you can even purchase bamboo babyled weaning bowls the parenting culture wars natural v medicalised birth breast v bottle fulltime work or stay at home attachment parenting or leaving babies to cry it out provide an impression of evenhanded debate in reality womens choices are covertly weighted by the fact that only the natural side is considered virtuous and valid in a maddening inversion natural motherhood is exclusively presented as womancentred midwives for example are portrayed as helping women achieve the drugfree births everyone is assumed to want but being cajoled and ignored when demanding anaesthesia and being guilttripped into parenting in a way that is not compatible with work outside the home is not what i call feminism natural motherhood is often neither natural nor womancentred it implies that the life of every mother but not father should revolve around the child i am for the child but i am for the mother too in the febrile public debate their interests are opposed in a zerosum game but mother and child are not rivals it is in each of their interests that the other is well and content the thalidomide scandal shocked many into questioning medical provisions for mothers yet the pendulum has now swung too far the other way as a result of paternalistic warnings about medication in pregnancy women are ceasing to take remedies for conditions as serious as bipolar disorder and epilepsy even when the risk to them is overwhelming intolerance of everyday imperfection is resulting in exhausted and bitter mums sidelined and resentful dads and children who are riskaverse and unable to tolerate disappointments mothers are trying too hard and society is not trying nearly hard enough yet the good news is that the conditions of contemporary motherhood are so retrograde that big improvements are well within reach proper care before during and after birth a rethink of work for both women and men and the transformation of societys incessant chastising of mothers into due value and respect motherhood is feminisms unfinished

a shocking series of murders of women in public places combined with rising levels of domestic violence and a wave of reports of sexual harassment in schools and colleges have set alarm bells ringing among all those concerned with the safety of women and girls protecting women from male violence including domestic and sexual violence has long been among feminists main goals along with political rights and economic independence yet half a century after the first uk womens refuge was established in progress in this and other areas has gone into sharp reverse the guardian has reported extensively on the crisis surrounding the policing and prosecution of rape and other sexual offences a combination of factors with a flawed approach to complainants personal data high on the list along with a more general deterioration in the court system due to cuts has produced a situation in which the vast majority of complaints never get to court in the year to the end of march cases of rape were recorded by police forces in england and wales leading to just prosecutions in light of such figures the delayed appearance of a longpromised rape review examining how allegations are dealt with is not only a failure on the part of government but a disgrace similarly the situation with regard to domestic violence is extremely concerning with evidence suggesting that the pandemic has made the position of many vulnerable women significantly worse and the increasing role of technology a particular problem the recent creation of a new offence of nonfatal strangulation and measures broadening the definition of domestic abuse were positive steps but rules preventing migrant women from accessing public funds for example to fund refuge places mean that they can continue to be abused with impunity last weeks queens speech announced a victims bill expected to specify service provision for domestic abuse victims and an online safety bill which will address among other issues misogynist abuse on social media platforms and online pornography but the lack of crime and justice announcements prompted labour to issue its own proposals for new laws a kind of shadow green paper including the creation of a new street harassment offence as has been introduced in france longer sentences for rapists and a set of indicators by which progress can be measured as an assertion of labours commitment to tackle these interconnected issues the document is very welcome the proposal to criminalise street harassment is a sound one as are plans to roll out improved training in the criminal justice system and develop violence against women as a specialism for prosecutors and in the court system the emphasis on sentencing is less useful although a sevenyear minimum sentence for rape is worth discussing for as long as the vast majority of reports of sexual offences are progressing no further than the police meaning that only a tiny proportion of rapists ever face justice this must be the focus for reformers in this area for the feminist criminal justice sector the failure of a judicial review aimed at altering the way that the crown prosecution service handles rape cases was a bitter disappointment the current situation with women justifiably alarmed both by levels of crime and the way such crimes are dealt with is intolerable on this central point the governments

its only three months since the ordeal of putting together my wifes piece jigsaw of ireland left him frustrated and defeated now my sons hands are a wonder of locomotion his once chubby fingers dextrous and nimble the picture of this one is a lion which he should know because he has done this jigsaw conservatively times but he never seems to be aware of this until he places the final piece then my little genius stands back delighted and shouts lion he started in earnest a few weeks ago and now finishes new jigsaws faster than i do im wary of those people who proclaim their childrens intelligence because its usually borne from love rather than an objective assessment often i know these kids quite well so it stretches my credulity to think of them as innately brilliant especially if ive recently seen them trying to eat batteries it has therefore been humbling to discover ive been wrong all this time some children actually are just really smart and special and its merely a coincidence that one of them is my perfect son the undisputed jigsaw genius of hackney my wife is excited by what his propensity for jigsaws can be extrapolated to hes a demon at jigsaws sure but im unclear how this could be used in other contexts jenga i guess and tetris i suppose but will this make him good at algebra or calculus im more literal so would be delighted if he just became increasingly good at jigsaws ive googled the world championships and am happy to report these are extremely competitive tournaments the top ranked british player is sarah mills at no two of the top three are czech and more than half the top are spanish that league table doesnt list a single player from ireland which is sad news for irish puzzlers but makes me think i could enter him as irish to carve out his own niche while also offering tribute to irelands proud history of stealing back our diaspora for sport id take it seriously you understand i can see myself now standing on the touchline at his big tournaments wearing a tracksuit whistle about my neck only dropping my handmade give piece a chance placard to pump my fist when he finished the corners or whatever it is a proper jigsaw dad does offering him moisturiser for his hands keeping him hydrated telling him to get out there and express himself one small unit of cardboard at a time id be supportive but not pushy you dont create the next jana hanzelkov or kateina novotn by piling the pressure hes enjoying his newfound genius and if he takes me with him to a life of fame fortune and segmented puzzling whats the harm in

an unforeseen sideeffect of adulthood is how babyish it has caused my life to become the most humiliating example which i share here as a sort of therapy and only because we are in our safe space is that these days i eat dinner at six six oclock god its practically lunchtime the sun high and looking down at us with its own particular brand of hot disgust but this is when our children eat transforming quickly into sad and hissing cats if pasta is not installed into their mouths within a regimented time slot and so during the first lockdown of intense childcare to avoid cooking twice we started to join them funny how quickly things slip into the sea a seemingly small decision rolling over evening by evening until now my stomach rumbles at half past five having trained itself like a dog this new regime however would not have been possible if the awfulness hadnt forced us to stay home and we were still working out in the world at our office and restaurant six oclock used to be when i would shut down my computer and start sloping out to the station it used to be the time my boyfriends shift at work began in the past a childminder afterschool club or kind grandparent would be responsible for feeding my daughter one of us blustering in gratefully afterwards to read a story since the pandemic closed schools and shielded grandparents at exactly the time we had our second baby we have inevitably reshuffled and squeezed our careers in order to watch our children and watch them we have with a glazed loving fury offering biscuits nipples netflix promises of better times all the while keeping one eye on our work and one ear on the news i am particularly attuned therefore to discussions on childcare a combination of reduced income and my partners new misshapen job means were looking after the baby ourselves rather than as we did with his sister depositing her daily at a childminders house you know how particular comments hook on to your insides and remain there forever im reminded now of one childminder prising my weeping toddler from my neck while telling me of course she hates you going to work youre not leaving her with me for her benefit youre leaving her here because you want to over the past six years ive continued that conversation silently in the shower on deadline any time i needed a little shot of energy explaining tightly that im not working simply for the fun of it im working to pay for childcare so that by the time my child is three and qualifies for free nursery hours i have still got a job childcare costs already prohibitively expensive have gone up in the past year to an average of a week or a year for one child in fulltime care although the costs vary massively across the country and spike wildly in the city where i live childcare fees account for almost of the average employed parents income after new zealand parents in the uk pay the most for childcare of any country in the world so i feel for the prime minister i do last week conservatives told the sunday times that party donors had been approached to pay for a nanny for wilfred boris johnsons youngest son this of course being the man whose entire career balances on his determined criticism of a nanny state a donor allegedly told one mp i dont mind paying for leaflets but i resent being asked to pay to literally wipe the prime ministers babys bottom well yes perhaps this donor scandal might cause johnson to think more closely about the cost of childcare rather than seeing childcare support as a favour to mums like free coffee at waitrose if you bring your own cup he might acknowledge it is an investment in the economy if they have children people typically reduce their working hours or stop work altogether so for every our government invests in childcare points out joeli brearley founder of pregnant then screwed the country gets back childcare is an investment not a cost but crouching between the lines of the johnson story is another about class and gender and who should care for a child the mother not if shes posh the father that would be cruel party donors tbc as johnson may be learning the reason many women whose salaries are typically lower than their male partners leave work to look after their children is not simply because of their soft maternal nature but because they cant afford not to many given the opportunity or a quiet bung from a benefactor with cash left over from the leaflet budget would also hire a nanny one benefit of eating dinner at six apart from the glorious bargaining over how many peas constitutes a mouthful is that there is then a whole unbroken evening ahead a whole evening once the childcare is over in which an adult can take the time to slide back into their own body temper their vigilance

domestic abuse cases requiring specialist support because technology has played a key role have soared over the last year the largest specialist provider of domestic abuse investigation services in england and wales has warned complex tech abuse cases involve perpetrators using multiple accounts and devices to abuse control and monitor their partners using a range of tech as well as sophisticated malicious software refuge which on any given day supports over women and children across its services said the average number of complex tech abuse cases for the period april to may this year was up compared with the average number in the three months before the outbreak of the pandemic tech abuse could involve abusive messages or calls hacking of phone or email cyberstalking posting malicious messages on social media controlling device passwords and usage or control of online banking among other behaviours the charity launched a specialist tech abuse team in but in response to the recent surge has set up a new website aimed at helping women secure their tech and to provide support if they are experiencing tech abuse ruth davison the refuge chief executive said over the last year as the uk moved to adopt necessary lockdown measures many of us have turned to our tech to connect with loved ones however at refuge were keenly aware that technology is often used by perpetrators of domestic abuse to further isolate intimidate and stalk their partners from their support networks making it even more difficult for women to escape their abusers our aim is to keep women safe from tech abuse while giving them the tools to secure their accounts and devices and maintain their digital activity into the future refuges ethos is to empower women to use their tech safely ensuring they arent forced into further isolation the new website provides survivors with the opportunity to learn about and recognise tech abuse has a new animation to illustrate common forms and experiences of tech abuse includes stepbystep support guides covering a range of device and account settings and has an interactive chatbot with video guides for securing accounts and devices in english urdu polish and spanish davison added as our lives are lived ever more through our computers and phones its crucial that women experiencing abuse are able to use their technology safely without fear of being monitored controlled and harassed an earlier report from refuges partner avast found a increase in the use of malicious stalkerware apps compared with the same time last year these apps are often used by perpetrators of domestic abuse to monitor their partners refuge has over tech champions who are also able to provide survivors with tech abuse support the conditions of lockdown in england and increased awareness about domestic abuse led to a surge in calls and contacts logged by the charitys domestic abuse helpline in the past year in the early stages of the

they spent a lot of time and money erecting a fancy new playground in the park beside our house during lockdown its mostly made from pale brushed wood which gives it the wholesome expensive feel of those little halffinished trains they sell in fancy kids shops these are really gifts for parents because children never like them as much as the cheap plastic ones you could have bought by the dozen for the same price luckily all the kids seem to like this playground just fine even though its less of a dayglo riot of fun and frolics and more like a dignified set of serene sculptures erected in memory of the person who invented jenga all the kids that is except my son he prefers the cluster of trees and bushes right beside it a little forest he finds much more fascinating it was also here that last week his heart broke my son had been hitting some leaves with sticks when another boy his age entered beside him ampilance my son said gesturing toward the ambulance knitted on to his visitors jumper receiving a blank stare this seemed sufficient for a rapid acceleration toward friendship so my son took the next logical step play hide and seek he proffered arms outstretched no replied his new companion quite forcefully before promptly running off my son stood mute first puzzled then crestfallen i rushed to console him as he began crying his head facing the ground like a scolded pup its an odd thing to witness such a concentrated stab of pain hitting someone whos not yet developed the emotional calluses necessary to compute it it shouldnt surprise me that my sons relationship with emotion is a bit brand new this is after all a person who cheers when ambulances go past when you spend enough time with a toddler your calluses fall away too as if some deep well of childish innocence is pumped directly to your adult brain in practice this means you may also find yourself cheering when emergency service vehicles fly past i explained that the boy didnt mean to hurt his feelings and sometimes people just dont want to play at the same time you do and in any case id be happy to play hide and seek with him if he wanted he regarded this offer with the polite contempt it probably deserved and dawdled by the sculpture park playground sniffling as he regarded its neatly carved curves i shouldnt have worried he played only for a few minutes before another child ran into his beloved forest hide and seek my son shouted all pain forgotten the joy of the spotless mind is that pain too is shortlived he hit the deck sirens blazing abandoning the pale wood he

police took over a month to disclose information about the criminal histories of suspected abusers in almost a quarter of applications for background checks approved last year observer analysis has found clares law introduced in gives people the right to ask their force about any previous domestic violence or offences that mean their partners could pose a risk to them home office guidance states that police will aim to complete the inquiries within days however data released under freedom of information laws shows that response times to out of right to ask requests approved by police in england and wales in fell below this target out of the forces able to provide full statistics for last year bedfordshire proportionally failed to meet the guidance most often as information relating to of the approved right to ask requests took more than days to disclose it was followed by leicestershire police which had a rate of with out of approved applicants waiting over days to find out whether or not the suspected abuser had a violent offending history the met derbyshire and staffordshire police by contrast revealed material within the advised timeframe for every request they disclosed in campaigners have reacted with alarm to the figures as timely background checks on a partner suspected of previous abuse may have proved vital for those confined to their homes during lockdowns the delays coincided with a surge in requests for information about partners potential violent pasts which more than doubled from in to last year according to responses from out of the forces in england and wales the data highlights unacceptable delays in police disclosure of information about a partners history of domestic abuse or violent acts said sophie franciscansfield senior campaigns and policy officer at womens aid we support placing the statutory guidance underpinning clares law on a statutory footing in the domestic abuse act this means that the police will have to adhere to the guidance and this should improve consistency throughout the forces including the length of time it takes to respond clares law or the domestic violence disclosure scheme is named after clare wood who was murdered by her exboyfriend at her home in salford in she had been unaware of his history of violence against women as well as members of the public being able to make requests under the initiative police can also proactively warn people who may be at risk through the right to know element but critics say a false sense of security can be created when people worried about their partners behaviour are told they have no past convictions as many domestic violence cases go unreported questions have also been raised over the reasons behind the huge disparity in how forces release the information essex police which did not respond to a request for comment disclosed only of the right to ask applications it received last year over the same period norfolk constabulary disclosed of the total requests it received jennifer cirone the designated adults safeguarding lead at the womens charity solace was involved in the pilot of the scheme some areas may employ a very conservative approach relying only on related convictions to determine disclosure she said other police areas may have a different approach that recognises that many people who present a risk may have been involved in concerning behaviour that has not resulted in charge or conviction timely information is really important for people in deciding what action they want to take delay can result in not only escalation of risk but making it more difficult for people to end an unsafe relationship if that is what they want to do obtaining details from other police services dealing with applicants who have moved addresses and safely releasing information requested by third parties such as concerned parents and neighbours are among the factors that can extend disclosure times a bedfordshire police spokesperson said that the pandemic had affected the training of new staff managing the applications and had made it harder to meet people at risk the force is optimistic that it will now be able to meet the home office timetable for the more than applications a month it receives a spokesperson for leicestershire police said the rise in the number of applications last year along with lockdown

children are not says julia donaldson with a smile going to write to her directly about the pandemic her assistant has just delivered a fresh pile of post and the author shuffles through a stack of opened letters to make the point children arent going to write oh dear i feel so lonely or overcrowded they are just writing their usual there were four kittens called mitten litten nitten and kitten they are so sweet some of the things they write if as well as her permanent affection for the nations children there is mild exasperation at being asked to act as their spokesperson as they emerge from another lockdown it can be forgiven as the creator of such beloved characters as the gruffalo tiddler and zog the former childrens laureate actor and singersongwriter has long been expected to help her readers think rhyme and imagine for themselves that responsibility goes with the territory a donaldson book sells about every seconds in the uk and between and she sold more than m books in the uk m more than any other writer and after a year of ongoing coronavirus restrictions on childrens socialising and schooling the grandmother of nine who is is particularly concerned about the impact on young lives one of my granddaughters loves singing she says she came back from nursery and her parents said oh what have you been singing today and she said singing spreads germs i feel it is criminal to stop people singing particularly children and i worry that there would be some children who grow not able to sing we all know that singing is what keeps us in good health in the sitting room of the home she shares with her husband malcolm a retired consultant paediatrician high windows flood the space with spring sunshine donaldson is examining page proofs for a new collection of traditional rhymes for younger children and imagining the venues where these might be spoken or sung while the scottish government made allowances for new parents groups last year all such sanitysaving gatherings ceased again across the uk under the winter lockdown i confess that my attendance at the local librarys bounce and rhyme sessions was as much for my own benefit as that of my newborn so important donaldson exclaims socialising with other mothers also ive heard that for some who maybe havent had a close relationship with their own parents its educational to see the physical contact and the bonding i remember anne fine also a former childrens laureate saying it was absolutely lifesaving to go to those sessions while the reopening of libraries will be welcomed across the generations their closure was a pressing matter well before covid in donaldsons role as childrens laureate from to she campaigned passionately against library cuts writing articles meeting ministers and with malcolm embarking on a sixweek tour of uk libraries her newest book in the acorn wood series cats cookbook is set in a library cat is looking for a recipe book but is sidetracked by the many literary tangents on offer until she finds what she is looking for under the direction of frog the helpful librarian with delightfully detailed illustrations by her regular collaborator axel scheffler and multiple book flaps for small fingers to lift it is a strikingly intricate product i love axels interiors donaldson says warmly he prefers doing nature and fairyland but i think he should be a furniture designer the stories themselves are a particular challenge to write she explains because you have to dream up a little ministory which has to be six spreads and the flap can only be on one side i remember going around completely in this world of flaps if i went to the loo id imagine that would be a flap during lockdowns donaldson has shared weekly videos online julia donaldson and friends was filmed from her sofa with musical accompaniment provided by malcolm on guitar and virtual visits from favourite illustrators such as scheffler lydia monks and nick sharratt showing children how to draw some of their favourite characters suddenly everything in the diary all the performances we were going to do were wiped out she says axel and i had done these coronavirus rhymes so i was thinking what else can i do at the start of the first lockdown they created a series of images showing how the highway rat stick man and others were coping with social distancing home schooling and isolation the gruffalo is shown walking metres behind the mouse in an update of a squash and a squeeze the animals bring the little old lady groceries while she selfisolates inside her house having lived with a hearing impairment as one in six of us do she points out since her s the unintended consequences of wearing masks also concern her even if you dont realise you rely on lipreading you probably do and wearing a mask makes you more likely to shop online or to go into big supermarkets and be totally anonymous where i live theres a lovely bustling high street with independent shops and for lots of older people thats how they stay sane they pop into shops they know the shopkeepers and have a little chat then suddenly all the shopkeepers have got to wear masks and they are probably just not going im not i stay at home because it makes me feel depressed the charity life amp deaf recently sent her a clear fabric mask that allows for lipreading but its those who are talking to deaf people whose lips need to be seen she is not arguing that face coverings are unnecessary she notes but if masks are to stay for a while it should be compulsory that they are seethrough donaldsons work is so easy and satisfying to read aloud that one can underestimate the skill that goes into such deceptive simplicity it is malcolm who reads the earliest draft she says if he stumbles over anything then i go back to it it has to scan its no good the mum or dad having to read it wrong the first time and then go oh thats where to put the strength she says you want the person instinctively to put the stress in the right place she warms to her theme the gruffalo lets say starts with a mouse took a stroll to the deep dark wood a fox saw the mouse and the mouse looked good her voice skips lightly across the syllables and one gets a flash of the captivating live performer she is it takes a long time to condense and theres a lot of work involved you dont just say once upon a time there was a mouse does he go for a walk a stroll in the wood whats going to be the last word in that line this familiarity with the architecture of poetry and song began in her early years when her grandmother introduced her to edward lears nonsense rhymes later she formed a keen understanding of the importance of an audience busking around europe with malcolm after they fell in love at bristol university performing comedy songs on the brighton folk scene in the s then taking her childrens musicals with a small cast to london and going on to write for the presenters of the bbc childrens programme play away it was only in as her three sons grew older and the family moved to glasgow that donaldson was contacted by a publishing house to ask if the words of her song a squash and a squeeze composed in could be made into a picture book for children donaldson has also just published a gruffalo and friends outdoor activity book a gloriously grubby guide to mud spells cobweb hunts and nutty hide and seek it is written in collaboration with little wild things a community organisation run by her daughterinlaw christine which provides outdoor play sessions in west oxfordshire its so nice when they can pick up a worm or handle dung beetles donaldson says approvingly her precovid schools visits often left her concerned that children cant tell the difference between a bluebell and a dandelion those are my earliest childhood memories learning about acorns and acorn cups and shepherds purse and buttercups theres so much talk about the environment and loving the planet how can you love the planet if youre not familiar with it there has been some discussion of whether the pandemic may have improved childrens relationship with the outdoors with so much socialising pushed into the open air over the past year even if you dont have a garden most places have got some nature we walked to quite a rundown area the other day but there still was a little stream and pussy willows and birds but indoors the unequal social impact of lockdown troubles her greatly weve already got a very wide gap between different schools but also within schools between children with very welleducated parents who have probably been taking home learning very seriously and other families who havent even got enough to eat let alone do their reading writing and arithmetic their letters might not ask her to directly but here she is asking that children be heard with the same clarity she longs for on her local high street cats cookbook and the gruffalo and

my adult child wants to move interstate but with the grandchildren how do i navigate my emotions being a parent and having a close bond with your children when they are adults is just so amazing we talk to each other about everything and anything they are not only your children but your best friends however i can tell you whats better than that being a grandparent i never thought that i would ever be one i had always hoped to but never actually imagined what it would look like or feel like i remember the day my daughter telephoned me to tell me their biggest and best news ever that they were pregnant i screamed down the phone and was crying with happy tears i was present when they had an ultrasound and was told that they were having not one but two babies i almost fainted when they said i told you im like beyonce its been months since the birth of these beautiful twins their greatest gift my greatest gift and i absolutely love them beyond words and have a very special bond with those two babies when i dont see them or hear from them at least once a day its a bad day so what do i do when the mother of these grandbabies tells me they are thinking about moving to queensland three states away from where i live my daughter is currently in queensland on holiday and facetimes me with the twins as they do almost every day only this time its a different call they tell me that they are thinking about moving back to queensland i say back because my children were raised in brisbane but my daughter moved to melbourne for university when they were and soon after we all followed my partner and i my son and youngest daughter when i heard them say this my heart was slowly breaking and my jaw was on the ground i stopped listening as i was trying to find words to say and then i heard i would only do this with your blessing you could hear a pin drop i needed to break the awkward silence i told them that they should probably wait until they got home to make lifechanging decisions because its one thing to be on a holiday and another to be actually living there i know this from experience recently i had a holiday in the cairns area and it felt so good being up there among the daintree rainforest that i pictured buying a little block of land and living up there but as soon as i got home to the cooler climate that i am accustomed to i quickly changed my mind i told my daughter that although i have been missing them and not just missing them but actually fretting for them and especially the twins so much that it has been almost unbearable some days as it has been the longest time that i have not been able to hold and cuddle these babies my mind was racing but when i looked back into the screen trying not to cry i looked into my daughters eyes and reluctantly told them that it didnt matter what i thought and they should make up their own minds i said i would support them and even suggested that the warmer climate may be good for the grandchildren in all honesty i am selfishly hoping that they decide to stay in victoria to live because i cant bear having a longdistance relationship with my grandchildren as i fear they will forget who i am and i dont want them to forget me but as parents we need to allow our adult children to make their own choices and decisions in life whether they are the right choices or wrong decisions its for them to make i know that my oldest daughter will always make the right decisions when it comes to their children and whatever they and their partner decide i will fully support them and make it work veronica

the labour mp stella creasy is threatening to take legal action after being told she cannot hire a locum to cover her maternity leave after the birth of her second child creasys preaction letter to the independent parliamentary standards authority ipsa which regulates mps pay and expenses comes as a bill to enshrine the right of flexible working in law is introduced into the house of commons this week the mp for walthamstow who is seven months pregnant became the first to use a pilot providing full locum cover for her first child but has been told she cannot have the same arrangement for her second ipsa told her the request was misconceived adding that the core parts of an mps job cannot in legal and constitutional terms be undertaken by someone else ipsa has offered the mp to cover extra costs over seven months to pay for staff who would be expected to escalate matters to the mp earlier this year the government pushed through a bill giving ministers access to six months maternity leave on full pay creasy said full maternity cover for mps was vital to reassure constituents while their mp was taking leave either my constituents will be shortchanged or my baby will lose me for six formative months this would be illegal in any other real workplace setting she said more than charities campaigners and business groups have signed a letter to ian todd the interim ceo of ipsa calling for him to overturn the decision joeli brearley the ceo and founder of pregnant then screwed who is supporting the campaign said parents need time to bond with their baby and women need time to recover from childbirth this decision means that an mp can do neither this is bad for democracy and for equality a spokesperson for ipsa said an additional senior staff member to cover mps absences would be able to fulfil all possible duties constitutionally no one can take on the full roles and responsibilities of a member of parliament who is an office holder elected by the general public they said in a statement it is up to parliament to decide if the law should be changed labours tulip siddiq is to present a crossparty flexible working bill before parliament on thursday data from the pregnant then screwed helpline shows twothirds of requests for flexible working were rejected in the first year of the pandemic the bill which has crossparty support and the backing of campaign groups and unions would give all workers a right to flexible working from day one and make employers highlight flexibility in job adverts more than supporters have written to their mps to encourage them to support the minute rule bill employees only have a right to request flexible working but businesses have no obligation to accept the conservative manifesto promised action on flexible working and the government recently promised a consultation later this year siddiq said despite a misconception that the pandemic had transformed flexible working there had been declines since march last year with lower income workers less likely to be allowed to work flexibly the current law is outdated and we need new legislation to make flexible working a right for all rather than

my son hadnt seen my father for a long time and touched us all by running full pelt across the front garden shouting granda as soon as we arrived this was however the last bit of attention he showed his human counterparts for the duration of our trip my dads house is deep in derry countryside and the terrain around us looks like the opening scene of emmerdale all rolling hills and patchwork fields the garden is festooned with yellow and purple flowers attended to by bees and butterflies and the view from our living room looks out across the foyle to sunny hillsides adorned with giant languid windmills again im struck by how much of this was lost on me as a child when id have given anything to live closer to the city my decidedly urban son has the opposite inclination marvelling at everything around him with a heartiness that shames my childhood self it doesnt hurt that my dads garden has somehow become a nature reserve since i last lived here i certainly didnt remember there being kestrels and buzzards overhead nor dozens of rabbits in our field maybe they were always there and i was too busy watching action movies with the living room curtains drawn but theyre here now in full view of our kitchen window to the amazement of a toddler who has only ever seen them on tv i momentarily wonder if my dad has hired them all in to tempt us to move home if that was the plan it may be working on my son who throws himself headfirst into passionate naturalism he hazards terrible guesses at the names of birds we encounter waves at men in tractors and generally gives off the air of a returning country gent temporarily housed in the evil metropolis for reasons beyond his control he picks flowers chases flies and moths both of which he calls bees but hes learning and strides excitedly in wellies with his hands behind his back his particular delight is annie my fathers new pup shes a jet black alsatianlabrador cross and the only creature for five postcodes as excitable as he is she yelps and cries with enthusiasm every time she sees him and he does the same trapping everyone in their orbit in a vortex of elation that is as pleasing as it is exhausting as a breather for both boy and dog my brother conall drives us to a nearby hill fort promising even more splendid views my wife and i coo at the scenery as my son goes quiet the excitement of the day comes to its

a community nurse who was sacked for not agreeing to work weekends has won a landmark ruling for working mothers after a judge said employment tribunals must take childcare disparity into account gemma dobson worked fixed shifts in order to care for her three children two of whom are disabled she was fired by north cumbria integrated nhs foundation trust in after she was unable to meet a new requirement for community nurses to work flexibly including some weekends dobson was unsuccessful at an employment tribunal citing unfair dismissal and indirect sex discrimination but has won an appeal before the president of the employment appeal tribunal mr justice choudhury in his written judgment with two other panel members choudhury said childcare disparity was a matter employment tribunals must take into account if relevant the panel said whilst things might have progressed somewhat in that men do now bear a greater proportion of childcaring responsibilities than they did decades ago the position is still far from equal the assumptions made and relied upon by the appellant are still very much supported by the evidence presented to us of current disparities between men and women in relation to the burden of childcare dobson who was supported in her case by the charity working families said she was left feeling utter disbelief at the outcome of the original tribunal and paid tribute to the support she had received from the charity her husband and lawyers it means everything knowing that others also believed in me and my strength in staying dedicated to my journey for justice she said i truly hope that in the future other working mothers wont be discriminated against for having caring responsibilities especially those that care for disabled children jane van zyl the chief executive of working families who gave evidence to the tribunal said losing the case would have represented a huge step backwards for womens workplace rights employment lawyer doreen reeves at slater and gordon who acted for dobson said working mothers should not be tasked to prove this assumption time and time again when they bring employment tribunal claims this important landmark decision gives a clear warning working mothers with caring responsibilities should not be penalised if they are not able to work flexibly to meet business needs or demands of a service the case will go back to the employment tribunal to reconsider the indirect discrimination and unfair dismissal claims north cumbria integrated nhs foundation trust said in a statement that it notes the judgment of the employment appeal tribunal it added the trust does not believe that is appropriate to comment further at this stage given that the matter will return to the original employment tribunal it is important to note that the employment appeal tribunal did not find in its judgment that mrs dobson was discriminated against or unfairly dismissed by the trust which is why the matter will return to the original employment tribunal for further consideration,2021-06,community nurse wa sacked agreeing work weekend ha landmark ruling working mother judge said employment tribunal must

three in four domestic abuse offences reported to the police are closed without a perpetrator being charged a watchdog has said amid fears the figures have worsened during the pandemic her majestys inspectorate of constabulary and fire and rescue services hmicfrs said forces were increasingly using two types of outcome to close domestic abuse cases the first being the absence of support from the victim and the second being a lack of evidence despite having the victims backing to prosecute zo billingham the inspector of constabulary said she was shocked that the figures which covered the year to march were so high and appeared to be worsening the data came to light as part of the watchdogs review into the policing response to domestic abuse during the coronavirus pandemic published on wednesday in which forces were largely praised for their proactive approach billingham said it is the polices job to build the case for the victim in many cases it isnt clear that forces are taking all the opportunities to undertake an effective initial investigation or that they desisted from pushing back the decision on to the victim so when was the last time any of us heard of the police asking a burglary victim if they wanted the police to take action it doesnt happen but it happens repeatedly in crimes of domestic abuse i am shocked that the crime closure rates are now so high and worsening and still forces still dont have a good understanding of the reason for this in my professional judgement it cannot be right that after domestic abuse crimes have been reported to the police largely by victims but admittedly on occasion by friends or families or neighbours but for threequarters of these crimes to close because of socalled evidential difficulties we are in a very difficult place in policing theres no other way of describing it billingham said there were wide variations between police forces in closure rates for domestic abuse incidents in forces of domestic abuse allegations were closed because of lack of evidence or lack of support from the victim to prosecute she said while the data covered the year to march there was no data to suggest the situation had improved during the pandemic hmicfrs has called on all forces to assess the closure rates for domestic abuse crimes and draw up a plan of action for improving them elsewhere the inspectorate said it was concerned about the impact of court backlogs on domestic abuse cases which while not for the police to solve may increase the likelihood of victims disengaging from the criminal justice process the national police chiefs council lead for domestic abuse the assistant commissioner louisa rolfe said the police response to domestic abuse has improved over recent years and that is reflected in our greater recording standards better training for officers and better risk assessment that said we are constantly learning and developing and will carefully consider the inspectorates findings and recommendations as we continue to get better,2021-06,three four domestic abuse offence reported police closed without perpetrator charged watchdog ha said amid fear figure worsened pandemic majesty

the furore over the name meghan and harry gave their baby daughter is one of the couples more relatable recent hoohahs picking a name for a child is a hellish nightmare up there with giving birth i imagine whatever you do you are condemned to betray your prejudices pretensions and class aspirations for all the world to see choose something unusual and you let everyone know you think youre fancy choose something boring like ed and you are sending a clear signal that this will be an average child unless you are blessed with extreme confidence or are one of those american families who just repeat the same name again and again adding numbers like factory prototypes in the months leading up to the childs arrival the question can assume monumental proportions for most parents the game is to walk the narrow path between boring and pretentious you dont want to condemn the child to a lifetime of being teased or saying the phonetic alphabet to customer services in the end we called our daughter lily it seemed a sensible enough choice but in hindsight i wonder if all the death in the news left a subconscious impression on us the moment the ink was dry on her birth certificate an article appeared announcing that lily had entered the list of most popular names seeing your babys name loom on to this list is a moment of selfreckoning verging on humiliation every parent believes they are responding creatively to a unique set of inputs then you turn up at nursery and discover everyone else had the same idea you have to concede that your careful choice was in fact the result of atmospheric forces that affected other parents exactly the same sorry daenerys free will is an illusion our lives might have been easier if wed had the help of cool names for babies a book my wife found in a charity shop a few weeks too late if youre not familiar with this classic of infant nomenclature the cover has a picture of a baby clutching a pair of sunglasses the big question today the authors write is what are the cool names and how can i choose one for my child they suggest taking a name whose sound you like and changing the spelling it only takes a bit of imagination for gavin to become kavin or travon keith turns easily into keithen alternatively drop syllables or letters these days they write drew and ward are cooler than andy and ed i tried not to take it personally for names with multiple iterations they supply a handy chart identifying the uncool cool and cooler versions you can spice up even the most uncool name by adding an x geoff isnt cool jeb is cool but cooler is jex and so on despite all the agonising over coolness naming convention remains astonishingly conservative each generation somehow finds its way to a set of about names that have reentered acceptability as has happened in recent years with audrey and iris and rose wilfred and arthur and alfred it takes a lot for a name to die forever although nigels not looking good imagine naming a baby born today norman or susan and you realise just how limited the range is in this as in space travel and batterypowered cars elon musk is breaking new ground he and his partner grimes named their son x axii an innovative use of x which only slightly looks like they entered their password in the wrong box the one truly radical act for a british parent is to pluck a name from further down the class ladder yet it might not be the worst idea for the downwardly mobile uppermiddle classes whose jobs in accounting and law are about to be replaced by elons robots they continue to worry that liam

my son delights in his new gummy boots those squishy rubbery shoes which were invented for kids so they can walk on jagged pebble beaches i know they sell them for adults but for some reason we never

i woke to the barely there contractions of early labour it was a few days before my due date in my second pregnancy a pregnancy seemingly without complications the moses basket was out and my hospital bag packed everything was ready for our baby boy he was kicking as normal as the day went on my contractions remained mild and far apart i kept to the plan discussed with our midwives stay at home as long as possible no rushing to the maternity ward i took our twoyearold son alex for a walk with a friend and we collected conkers when i sang twinkle twinkle little star at alexs bedtime the baby kicked hard as he had done most days as if he recognised the song knew our routine not long after a shiver went through me something felt wrong the babys movements had slowed i called the number for our community midwives had i tried drinking something cold eating the things that made him kick the midwife asked i had but i tried again while on the phone nothing she told me to go to my hospital kings in south london and to explain i had hardly felt the baby move for a while i took a minicab leaving my husband at home with our sleeping son i imagined someone would scan the baby reassure me and send me home to try to sleep before my labour really got going at the very worst they would tell me the baby was in some kind of danger and he would be delivered by emergency csection his father would miss the birth but they would have all the years that followed the maternity ward was quiet it felt empty but it probably wasnt i was seen immediately by a friendly but calm midwife she was silent as she scanned our baby running over and over him then stopping in one place i dont know who told me i have different versions in my mind though only one can be true i think the midwife went out and came back with a doctor i do remember the words your babys heart has stopped another doctor came in scanned and told me the same i refused to believe it i asked the doctors to restart his heart it couldnt stop beating while he was still attached surely im alive so he must be i said get him out save him it doesnt work like that the doctor said hes died still i would not believe it i told them that my brother and my father had both died so there was no way my son could die the doctors had to tell me again our baby was dead i called my husband and as the phone rang i contemplated telling him to come but not why maybe it could wait but that felt wrong so i told him the babys heart stopped i didnt say the words dead or died our friend who was on standby to look after alex arrived at our house and my husband came to the hospital by then it was late at night we were taken to a delivery room where a brilliant midwife looked after us she kept us talking distracted us with stories organised an epidural when i was so distressed that i couldnt stop wailing sorry and that it was all my fault she brought in doctors to reason with me to explain that sometimes babies just die all through the night the labour speeding up i kept hoping they were wrong that our baby would come out alive he was delivered on the morning of sunday september he had died at some point on the saturday and was stillborn we called him finn the midwife i had called the night before arrived for finns birth and stayed with us afterwards she asked if we wanted her to take photos of us holding him i am so glad she did we didnt know what to do we were still in total disbelief that our son was not alive in truth i thought stillbirth was something that happened centuries ago i knew babies could die from complications during delivery or after birth but i had told myself it hardly ever happened and i did not know a fullterm baby could simply stop living in the womb tragically our kind of loss is not as rare as you would hope every day in the uk about babies die before during or soon after birth according to the stillbirth and neonatal death charity sands finn was one of those babies back home without him i tidied cleaned and made biscuits all exactly the same size anything to feel in control at night i felt for him kicking in the mornings i woke up having forgotten about the hospital and for a moment thinking i was still pregnant then i would remember i clung to our toddlers routine naps meals walks to collect more conkers he loved dancing to lady gaga and abba and they were playing most of his waking hours alex was old enough to ask where his promised baby brother was but too young to understand the answer one of the hardest things in those early days was telling people what had happened friends were expecting happy news and baby pictures instead we had to find the words to say our son had died just before he was born people were kind and supportive but didnt know what to say the house filled with flowers and cards friends donated to our fundraiser for the nspcc which we held in finns memory many wrote letters and emails dropped off cakes some stayed to talk my friend naomi phoned every morning asking is today a good day or a bad day she promised me i would get through the worst days that they would become fewer and of course she was right other parents invited us on trips to the park friends took me out in the evenings distracting me and at the same time repairing my battered selfesteem despite my grief and my enduring sense of guilt about finns death their invitations told me i was still good company we went away with another family the weekend before finns funeral my brother looked after alex so that my husband and i could get out of the house alone through the sands stillbirth and neonatal death charity i made new friends who had also lost babies we talked about what had happened to us how others had reacted our fears about trying again some friends asked what had happened and i was grateful to be given the chance to share our birth story as distressing as it was my oldest friend asked if i might show her photos of finn and it made him feel more real to me and eased my guilt about not having the usual baby pictures to share we had outstanding support from the nhs right from the moment the scan confirmed finn had died our community midwives and health visitor answered our questions about practical elements such as what would happen now i wasnt breastfeeding how to organise finns funeral and what to expect from the postmortem which ultimately found no cause for finns sudden death a bereavement midwife dropped round a disc with photos taken of finn at the hospital for us to look at when we were ready there were prints from his hands and feet too we had excellent care from the hospital psychotherapist some people said nothing usually people i didnt know well such as those at our toddlers music group they had seen me with a bump now the bump was gone and yet i was never with a baby they probably assumed i had left the baby with a nanny or relative i let them believe it but the longer that went on the more i worried about someone asking with hindsight at both that group and at alexs nursery i wish i had emailed someone in charge and asked them to tell the other parents what had happened all the guessing by them and counterguessing by me could have been avoided there were some more hurtful moments but thankfully they were rare a baby announcement arrived in the post and its picture of a newborn floored me i would never begrudge anyone else their healthy baby but that card left me sobbing why cant i have my baby too there was a dinner just weeks after finns death when no one mentioned what had happened to us i suspect our friends wanted to give us a night off from our grief but we wondered if the message was not to talk about our son any more with all these situations unanswered emails the nursery gate strange dinners i felt it would always have been better to say something rather than nothing to a grieving person even a simple hows it been going gives the person a chance to talk or they can respond with a fine or soso if they would rather not then again not all things that were said to us were helpful one reaction to finns death stood out it was from someone i didnt know well but whom i had promised to let know that our baby had arrived safely i texted that i was sorry to share sad news and that finn had died then came the reply that everything happens for a reason the phrase infuriated me with all the pain and injustice in the world how could someone believe that it also deepened my guilt the reason was surely something i had done or would have done had finn lived i clearly wasnt fit to be his mother i like to think that in different circumstances i would have dismissed everything happens for a reason but in shock and desperately wanting life to make sense it consumed me i made lists of possible reasons and asked anyone who would listen if they believed it the days became easier with the passing of time and with the psychotherapists support we saw her again when i was pregnant for a third time with ella who is now nine i let go of everything happens for a reason things just happen no reason nature is wonderful and cruel alex and ella grew went to nursery to school we talked and still talk about finn the photo of us holding him is on the wall in our house i returned to work covering economics at the guardian my job as a reporter was busy and rewarding but something niggled at me i wanted to write something longer more creative then the character of rachel summers came to me and i began writing her story her son is stillborn like finn and rachel too is told that everything happens for a reason she is certain she knows the reason the day she found out she was pregnant she had stopped a man from jumping in front of a train the man must have taken her babys place and she resolves to track him down what started as a character became a novel that i hope brings baby loss a little further out of the shadows its title is that phrase that so tormented me everything happens for a reason i still hate those words yet i know its hard to find the right words when someone is grieving despite losing a son a brother and my parents i still struggle to write something that might be of comfort in condolence cards ultimately i know that whatever i say i can never give a bereaved person their loved one back but i do believe that the better

as a child i loved unsolved mysteries and im not talking about detective novels im talking about those big fat cheaply printed volumes you could buy from woolworths which anthologised everything from the mary celeste and the loch ness monster to kaspar hauser to the enfield poltergeist throwing in the yeti and the moberlyjourdain incident for good measure i gobbled them up as well as being an avid reader of fortean times and an avid watcher of the paranormal series strange but true s television introduced me to things that a small child really has no business knowing about such as spontaneous human combustion the black and white image of a burnedout armchair where a person used to be with only their charred legs remaining will probably never leave me second only to ghosts was my fascination with ufos and aliens the s was big on aliens alien autopsy came out in and we children all thought it was real it seemed as though quite a few adults did too and perhaps partly owing to that film as well as independence day in causing such a stir aliens were everywhere on tv on tshirts and in the playground in the form of eggs containing goo aliens which fevered rumours said could actually reproduce this has since been proved false to almost no ones surprise so its fitting that at the same time that the s are fashionable again aliens are also back in the news with a pentagon report on ufos due to be released some time later this month looking at sightings by military personnel some of these videos such as the sighting by a navy pilot of a tic tac shaped object near san diego are already available online ive watched them because really what else is the internet for but they didnt give me the same sense of wonder or excitement that i used to have as a kid if the truth is out there im not sure im all that bothered about hearing it dont misunderstand me i am not an incurious person and in a way i am right in the target market for this sort of story sort of agnostic a bit hippydippy kind of believe in ghosts in the sense that im likely to end any argument about their existence by saying there are more things in heaven and earth horatio than are dreamt of in your philosophy even though no one else seems to regard it as the trump card that i do especially now that cern has essentially disproved their existence but theres a scientific basis for aliens which somehow makes them less exciting to the s child inside me thats not to say that i dont want them to exist like david kestenbaum whose contribution to the fermis paradox episode of this american life is a must listen i get sad when i think about the prospect of all that cold dark empty space and not because we want deliverance as the writer sarah jones speculated recently im not convinced any alien lifeform could sort out the plagueridden binfire that is our planet at the moment but because the thought of human beings as the most intelligent lifeforms in the universe is very depressing especially in though really we have enough to deal with at the moment without a potential alien invasion the past year has been a lot we dont need another looming disaster in the mix also for a couple of years now i have had the eerie uncanny feeling that we are in the future and this has only been exacerbated by the dystopian feelings wreaked by the pandemic when elon musks starlink satellites passed over london recently appearing in the sky like a bright dotted line of stars it felt like it was here with technology like that in existence strange aerial phenomena seem even more likely to have a scientific explanation these days and while optical illusion or secret military technology are less captivating explanations i guess thats a part of growing up and yet the child who used to lie in bed kept awake by the terrifying thought of alien abductions wants the mystery to live on i want the loch ness monster to possibly be a plesiosaur that somehow survived and the curse of tutankhamun to maybe exist and ghosts to almost definitely be roaming the corridors of creepy old inns across the land yet in this world of fake news and conspiracy theory i realise my desire for mystery is no longer so innocent its as important to cling to rational scientific evidence as ever and an answer isnt always a letdown the moberlyjourdain incident which involved two british women who while walking in the gardens at versailles claimed to have seen the gardens as they would have been in the th century complete with the ghost of marie antoinette and others seems to have a plausible explanation hilariously it seems that these ladies may have stumbled upon a massive gay fancy dress party marie antoinette may well have been the flamboyant aristocrat poet robert de montesquiou in drag so sometimes even if a paranormalobsessed child would not agree the logical explanation is sometimes even more pleasing than the mystery itself rhiannon lucy cosslett is a guardian

there is no such thing as reproduction when two people decide to have a baby they engage in an act of production so begins andrew solomons brilliant book far from the tree about parents learning to accept their childrens differences which i read during my first pregnancy i get it i thought parents shouldnt narcissistically expect their children to be the same as them but just because my kids arent the same as me that doesnt mean they shouldnt be forced to have exactly the same childhood as me my parents very much did not make me watch howdy doody or whatever shows they grew up with but while other modern children are raised on cbeebies and paw patrol mine get s tv shows and movies poured down their gullets this allows them to enjoy wholesome classics such as dogtanian and the princess bride and allows me to relive my peak years everybody wins except possibly my children who on seeing a little boy dressed as harry potter on halloween asked if he was the witch in the wizard of oz theyre like the amish kid in witness bemused by the modern world but theyre also bemused by the past i expected to have to explain some things to them mainly from the american shows mister rogers reading rainbow that i have merrily forced on them you know educating them in the exotic linguistic differences zee for zed and so on but i didnt anticipate that i would be explaining actual ancient history this started when we watched back to the future which is one of those rare s films i watched as a kid that is just about suitable for kids on that subject police academy is way racier than my memories of mahoney suggested my children naturally loved marty mcfly they didnt fall that far from the tree and they grasped the concept of time travel but something else threw them its in the scene when martys in the diner in what is that weird box hes walking into thats a phone box its what people used to make calls in before they had mobiles i said they stared at me as if i spoke of a time before people had oxygen which doesnt say great things about how much they see me with my phone but lets ignore that it got worse what is that book martys looking in thats a phone book its how people found out other peoples numbers i said suddenly understanding how my grandfather felt that time he told me about growing up without indoor plumbing now lets take this apart back to the future is about a teenager who travels back in time years sure people in dont know about diet sodas or padded jackets or reruns and chuck berry songs dont exist yet but overall the world in is recognisable to a kid from he knows what a phone box and phone book are for a start to kids born in however as my twins were both worlds are completely baffling why look up someones phone number in a book instead of on the phone itself thank heavens marty didnt then use a phone card surely the most baffling phoneaccessoryfromthepast of all its the same thing with sesame street if bert cant find ernie why

it was just about the moment when i loudly cheered the crunching tackle that took out a child and left him on the floor that i realised that i may have crossed a line in my spectating of my sons football team for the last few weeks i have been spending sunday mornings watching them and as with many extracurricular activities discovered that there are a whole series of social etiquette issues and parental judgments involved that i hadnt anticipated first just to be clear the kid who was floored got up and walked away unhurt it was an example hilariously of a very young child mimicking professional footballers which means there are lots of children collapsing and rolling around on the grass in a way that you never would if you were actually injured there have also been some insanely overthetop goal celebrations we are yet to see the kids surround the referee but theyre only six so lets give it a year when my son first announced that he wanted to play football my initial overriding emotions were hope and guilt hope that he had inherited competitiveness and sporting prowess from his mother and guilt about anything that i had passed on to him i was and am horrendous at all sports its pathetic i have long searched for evidence of an undiagnosed condition which symptoms are a complete lack of ability in anything physical combined with a complete lack of motivation to get any better at them it has led to a lifetime of trying to avoid kickabouts and even pool tables i now hope beyond hope that the curse hasnt been passed down to my boys i started by watching the matches in silence i still have vivid memories of playing football for my school we lost and i retired from the game for ever and hearing parents shouting advice at their kids my father never did that i suspect because it would be like trying to encourage a bear to speak spanish by yelling at it i decided that i would just watch and encourage silently that sat in somewhat stark contrast to some of the other parents who spend their mornings shouting things like linear and stay up and close him down and pressure him i would feel a bit of a fraud saying things like that given that i am completely incapable of doing them myself in fact i would go so far as to say that if i stepped on to the pitch to play even among the sixyearolds i would find myself out of my depth its also very different from the way i watch arsenal play whether on tv or at a match i feel completely comfortable shouting at the team that ignores the fact that i know infinitely less about the game than anybody im watching but what is being a football supporter if its not speaking with unchallenged authority towards a group of much more qualified people decades of this have also proved excellent training for many armchair scientists during the pandemic gradually i have found myself getting more and more into the games the team my son plays for are new so it took them a while to catch up with the other clubs who had been playing together for a while they have gone from getting hammered every week to competing and now to winning i have to admit im getting into it i stop short of giving advice but i shout encouragement to my son and even to the team if he is subbed off a joke by the way he is essential and then last week i celebrated that kid being taken out in a way that may have surprised some of the other parents on the way home my wife talked about the game in a tone that i felt was her subtly telling me to be a little bit quieter going forward but im not going to let her hold me back,2021-06,wa

how can i feel less guilty about not wanting to play with my kids after my daughter was born i threw myself into motherhood with the fervour of a convert when she was a baby i studiously read to her and got her toys that made scrunchy sounds to aid in her development when she was a toddler i made play dough and edible slime and played dressups i think of this past me often with the head shake and wistful smile of someone who is now the beatendown working mother of three kids as i look back today knee deep in the murky underworld of home schooling and lockdown where screen time limits and controlling sugar intakes are a thing of the past i think of making play dough from scratch and laugh who even was that woman on a particularly brisk morning last week i found myself standing inside a playground watching my sons maniacally push themselves around on a squeaky roundabout as i stood there stomping my feet trying to bring some feeling back into my toes in the cold i fantasised about being at home with a warm drink and silence not hearing another plea for mum not having to hurry up and finish peeing so i can attend to another sibling quarrel just me inside the house with no sound the fantasy was quickly quashed as my kids ran up to me asking for snacks why did no one warn me about how much kids ate especially when they are at home all day i decided perhaps it was time to cut our playground visit short but then i remembered our living room now a holding space for disassembled lego sets errant uno cards and glue sticks with lids off leaving sticky trails on the dining table going home would mean id have to play with them as much as i love my kids and ive done everything to structure my life so their needs come first im over playing with them i dont want to make lego i dont want to join their makebelieve star wars games i dont want even want to sit though prolonged board games with them im just deeply bone tired and id rather they go off and play by themselves for the most part they do which is one of the benefits of having three children in lockdown despite their daily tiffs and arguments at least they have each other but they also need me not just to play with them but to be caregiver cook counsellor teacher nurse secretary and a whole host of other roles for the most part the other roles i can do but playing in my hierarchy of needs is one i need to get off my list anthropologists have written about how adultled play with children is not something thats done in many societies and may not be completely beneficial to our children as the anthropologist david lancy told the new york times children are built for autonomous learning they are born knowing how to create their own toys design their own games and to settle their own arguments they need surprisingly little interference from adults studies have shown that we should allow our children to be bored dr teresa belton told the bbc the pressure on kids to constantly be doing something could hamper their imagination all this is well and good but what about the guilt i feel when im not playing with my kids the mother guilt that haunts most women means that no matter what choices we make we feel bad about perceived shortfalls many will judge me for not wanting to play with my kids we are sold an image of motherhood of a woman who is on the ground with her children laughing engaging and having fun im sure there are women who do enjoy the mess of creating a mud kitchen or filling a tray full of foam and hiding dinosaurs in it perhaps i was once one of them but now im someone who has to fulfil a whole host of other needs for a long time i couldnt shift the guilt that i wasnt doing enough but then i told myself to get real my kids are lucky enough to have the active presence of both their parents in their lives if they injure themselves there will always be someone there to soothe them if they come across a complicated maths equation or tricky homework task they will know they can come to me or my husband for help and thats what im trying to focus on they may never remember the lego sets i didnt help them build to be fair if they ever read this i did build a lot of lego but they will remember that i was there for them when they needed me on that day in the playground when my kids came running asking for snacks i dug my hand into my backpack and magically procured an old packet of raisins their needs met they ran back to the squeaky roundabout laughing as they pushed each other around it was far from a perfect morning but it was close enough,2021-07,feel less guilty wanting play kid daughter wa born threw motherhood fervour convert wa baby studiously read got toy made scrunchy sound aid development wa toddler made play dough edible

every parent of a young child in lockdown either knows this fact or is about to learn it you dont get to choose where they find their joy for example my two and half year old son likes to listen to the thomas and friends storytime podcast it is by some margin his favourite thing to do by a similar margin the opening toot toot of the podcast is my least favourite sound on the entire planet which now activates my fight or flight reflex every time i hear it but due to some quirk of evolution i find myself unable to deny my boy his train show as it gives him the kind of happiness unattainable to adults without the use of classa drugs nonetheless i am genuinely confronted by how much i hate this show and the trains therein some of this can be chalked up to entering our fourth week of lockdown with no end in sight most of it can be chalked up to thomas and friends storytime being a bad show about trains who i hate there are lots of interesting reasons to hate this show but im not getting into any of them here this is simply a list of all the trains in the show ranked by how much i hate them this ranking is not definitive those in a similar position to me may wish to make their own list of trains they hate from their childs train podcast it doesnt need to be a train podcast specifically thats driving you insane in lockdown for me however and i really cannot stress this enough it is nia nia is the least objectionable train in my sons train podcast possibly because shes afforded so little airtime i cant tell you much about nia other than that shes painted orange which is fine and that she was once tasked with bringing an elephant to the sodor animal park and the elephant ran away which is not gordon a lot of people dont like gordon who is haughty and rude but i feel an affinity with this train because the contempt in which he holds all the other trains on the island of sodor comes very close to matching my own there arent a lot of gordoncentric episodes in thomas and friends storytime but as if to make up for this the actor shouts each of his lines at an upsetting volume gordon doesnt get into adventures like the other trains and seems to be very into the core business of being a train it is for this reason alone that he does not rank higher henry im told that theres a famous episode of the old tv show where henry is bricked up in a tunnel for all eternity as a punishment for disobedience i am not exaggerating when i say that if this happened to any of the trains in thomas and friends storytime i would take my shirt off and run around the living room like id just won the world cup henry is not entombed alive in the podcast which is a great shame diesel diesel is a dieselpowered shunting engine and is the closest thing thomas and friends storytime has to an antagonist why is he the antagonist well when the reverend w awdry was dreaming up the magical island of sodor to delight and entertain a generation of children he decided to establish a blood feud between the diesel and steam powered engines i can only assume he did this for his own inscrutable protestant reasons and the end result is a kind of completely incongruous sectarian tension that runs through the series diesel is the head of the diesel faction on sodor and once stole a christmas tree pathetic rebecca my son has episodes that he likes more than others thomas animal friends featuring rebecca is his favourite episode of all and as a result i know thomas animal friends better than literally any piece of media or art i have ever encountered i have more clarity around the events that unfold in thomas animal friends than anything that has ever happened to me in my actual life including the birth of my son it is for this reason that i would like to see rebecca the large tender engine exploded by huge amounts of dynamite cranky the crane ill be the first to admit that cranky the crane is not a train he still makes my list james in the lumiere brothers premiered their film larrive dun train en gare de la ciotat its a second clip of a train arriving at a station and when it was first shown in paris the audience were so terrified that they ran screaming from the room this was prescient as years on it is my exact reaction when james the red engine appears in any episode of thomas and friends storytime james is billed as the funny engine to begin with this is a lie james does nothing at any point in any of the episodes that could even be generously described in those terms the podcasts insistence that james is comic relief might be what tips me over the edge in lockdown ripping our speakers from the wall and walking them and myself into blessed traffic thomas the only reason that this guy isnt at number one is that the other day we were at the park and my son held out his arms and ran down the path and said toot toot im thomas with a huge smile on his face which was the best thing to happen to me all week nonetheless thomas is a huge piece of shit and no doubt about it jrr tolkien once said that cellar door was the most beautiful sounding phrase in the english language this was only because he had never heard the phrase thomas the tank engine has been turned to atoms by a futuristic beam weapon percy and so by default percy the green engine is my most hated engine on thomas and friends storytime he is in most of the

each year for my fathers birthday we usually bunch up and get him something nice its partly so we can avoid doubles i think his current record is receiving four copies of one album by northern irish folk singer cara dillon in one year and partly because if we join forces the of us can get him something nicer than the sum of our parts i suppose its the best thing about having children frankly i would argue it must be the only good thing it certainly marks an improvement on the policy which existed when we were kids and daddy had to personally hand us the money we needed to buy him his presents each year even at the time this seemed flamboyantly misjudged few financial investments could be as maddeningly obtuse as taking money from your own pocket handing it to thick but wellmeaning children and expecting them to return with something that you would ever conceivably prefer to the money itself giving money to me at age six would have made about as much sense as lending a kebab to your dog i simply couldnt be trusted with it and youd almost certainly have to disinfect whatever i came back with when i was done weve gotten much better at giftgiving in our advanced age this is coming out two days after the event so i think its ok for me to say hell love the copies of my book ive convinced my siblings to go in on with me but my dads birthday has become fraught for other reasons i dont mean in existential terms about his ageing since he long ago promised us hell live forever i mean how much more i appreciate his labours as i get older on fathers day my fond words are interspersed with moments in which we shoot the breeze about parenting dad to dad in some pathetic facsimile of fatherly equals birthday calls with my dad on the other hand usually spiral into long gibbering thank yous for everything he did to bring us up even remotely sane its not that i didnt appreciate him before i had a child of my own its just that i was unable to really get under the skin of his achievements until id stared directly into the burning fire of parenthood this is not unique to me i believe each of his sarcastic mocking children have at one time or another stepped on a yoghurt or pulled a small shoe out of the toilet and felt the need to call him to apologise for everything for breaking windows and blocking toilets for buying him pokmon cards one birthday because i was sure you said you loved these forever being children in the first place and most especially for all being children at the same time which does seem highly unreasonable of us realising just how difficult terrifying and boring parenting can be is enough to make us spend the rest of our lives affording him some form of compensation for the job he did for that he deserves to be thanked

we were harvesting wild oysters from the cold tasmanian waters three days after visiting family in sydney when the south australian government announced the border closures fourteen days i said aghast to my husband no leaving the house and no daycare as we returned home to the adelaide hills that feeling of dread grew how was i going to make it through two weeks without a single break from our monthold simone since i sold my book to a publisher when she was only five months old simone has attended a wonderful local daycare at first she refused to take a milk bottle so i would drop her off then sit in my car in the rain with no cafes or libraries open due to the virus writing and waiting to be called in to breastfeed my child over time our daughter settled into daycare and began to really like it reaching out her arms to hug the educators at dropoff i relished the chance to write my book and run the magazine i publish from am to pm four days a week i loved knowing that our baby was playing with other little ones climbing and singing and learning however at home i found it difficult to create a space that might compete with the daycare zone designed explicitly for children to play our farm where we grow veggies and make wine felt like the most stressful place to be with my child as she learned how to walk there were giant hills tractors machines whirring in the shed all of which she gravitated toward despite my pleas to play with toys inside as months passed i became increasingly uncertain about how to be at home with simone the hustle of driving her to and from her daycare a minute round trip twice in a day wore me down over time i began smoking again after a month cessation to relieve the boredom of the return trip after dropoff and to cope with a rough bout of postpartum depression and because every writer loves distractions i used pickup as an excuse to spend time at the shops there always seemed to be some ingredient missing at home while my daughter was away i felt pangs of guilt and i missed her but still every monday i awoke like pavlovs dog frothing at the mouth to get our child to daycare now we were facing days without it at a local bush playgroup we recently attended the instructor who was influenced by rudolf steiners educational philosophy mentioned that a day at home with a child is important for their development but it terrified me how to fill the gaping day when my toddler could hardly hold a crayon had the attention span of a butterfly and i was loath to let her watch more than a halfhour of television mummy blogs offered activities which made me shudder thinking of the giant mess id have to clean up pinktinted water all over the couch no thanks the first few days of quarantine it rained we watched peppa pig and bluey on the couch until i couldnt take it anymore i closed the ipad and announced that we were having a dance party my husband projected whitney houston on to the wall and our daughter bounced to her feet and began sashaying and wiggling we laughed for the first time in a while the next morning we had a leisurely breakfast of pancakes as if it were not a wednesday then all morning i followed simones lead if she crawled on the floor and growled like a monster i pretended to be scared and she chased me if she pointed at balloons we blew them up and bopped the globes around when she banged on the door we rugged up and went outside at one point i planted snapdragons while simone used her childrens gardening tools to pour water all over the patio and dribble a mixture of compost and wet sand throughout the herb garden screaming with glee back inside we brought out some plasticine rolled it into logs and made hissing sounds like snakes the day went by in a blur of activity and i felt a complete absence of anxiety before long a week had passed and then two the dance party became a nightly routine branching out into saltnpepa and kate bush when the sun came out we took walks looking for edible mushrooms and something unexpected was happening now i awoke to the luxurious awareness that our daughter would be with us all day i welcomed this new sensation my daughter too was different never had i seen her so happy and calm and perhaps it was just a matter of her crossing the month threshold but she seemed to play independently in a new way simone even obliged me answering some emails while she ransacked a bottom drawer filled with phone chargers and accessories interrogating each one i suddenly felt totally fine relaxed even about being at home with our toddler being forced to spend two full weeks on our farm with her having no playgroup to break up the day or childcare to rely upon revealed that the problem was never my relationship with her nor was it that we needed more toys or a different kind of home the problem was my own inability to do nothing to just simply be quarantine surprisingly provided emotional release from the crippling feeling of mum guilt the sense that i am a bad mother because someone else is caring for her even if simone herself enjoys it obviously quarantine might have felt differently if i worked say as a florist and missed out on two weeks pay running a business from home however has always meant that the separation between domestic life and work is blurry a tricky balancing act that now im aware i need to work on in the end our daughter has returned to daycare but ive learned that our family life can exist without it rachel signer is a writer based in the adelaide hills publisher of pipette magazine and author of you had

for her first few years of life my daughter ella likely thought the television played a single piece of content the version of george balanchines nutcracker starring as the title role one macaulay culkin who spends the majority of the ballet running around stage and flourishing his arm as the corps of the new york city ballet actually dances my mother had mentioned the story to ella one day and id found this free version by chance on youtube it was charming and on the scale of really bad things you can expose your child to seemed pretty anodyne as a millennial parent i was highly attuned to this scale spending my days wading through a morass of screaming headlines arguing that even a few minutes of screen time might set my child down the asocial vitamin ddeprived path of playing fortnite hours a day and subsisting on soylent but as ella got older and started to suspect this magic screen might hold other treasures i decided to get a handle on how to approach the television what i learned helped me form a cornerstone of our households tech philosophy for life with preschool children firstly todays childrens programming is wildly more fastpaced and frenetic than programming of yore watch a few minutes of the powerpuff girls which cuts every few seconds and sprouts neon colors that might render your tv visible from outer space and it feels like snorting four tablespoons of espresso compare this to older childrens programs like mister rogers shot by a single camera and featuring a man who speaks at half the speed he puts on his cardigan and youll immediately see the difference the rapid cuts common in newer childrens shows cue the brain to perk up and refocus attention scientists call this an orienting response the more cuts in a given minute the worse it is for your child by design television programs exploit our orienting response write drs dimitri christakis and frederick zimmerman in the elephant in the living room which explores the effect of television on children with few exceptions there are more quick cuts now than there were before for a glimpse at the upshot take this horrifying finding from one of christakis studies for every hour of daily television that a child aged watches the childs risk of developing attention problems consistent with adhd increases by secondly one of the activities most important for developing brains is the kind known in academic and medical fields as serve and return interactions and the presence of screens dramatically reduces them the idea is that the more communication a child experiences and the more she or he is exposed to language the more resilient and successful and social she or he will go on to be television is slightly better for children if you the parent participate in the experience of watching and engage them in conversation about what theyre watching but to do so you have to be able to see the screen which led me to one of my biggest takeaways dont hand your child a personal tablet if you can help it watch on as big a screen as youve got why kids create a walledoff space dr jenny radesky told me about tablet usage in the underfourfoottall set she is one of the lead authors of the aap digital media guidelines for young children and runs a lab at the university of michigan in one study she conducted to determine how tablets affect parentchild interactions she watched as parents were forced to lie melodramatically over the back pillows of couches neck craned at unnatural angles as their offspring balled up and edged them out the smaller the screen the more tiny elbows come out a separate issue altogether is the idea of handing your child a tablet or smartphone in the hopes that they might learn something from an app research shows that children under the age of five have an exceedingly challenging time learning from a d screen and translating that into the d world without help so unless youre right next to your kid playing along you should probably give up on the idea that its enriching of course no one is expecting that parents are going to stop frozen every few minutes to quiz junior on the benefits and detriments of being able to turn ones world into ice youre likely putting on the cartoon so you dont have to engage at all and there are at my conservative and highly unscientific estimate million other opeds to be written about why american parents need to resort to screen time as they navigate a world without the social support they deserve but at least if you can see the screen you might be able to use it as a jumping off point for interaction i know its a ludicrous request these days because tv is being used as a babysitter but im constantly asking parents please watch with your child rosemarie truglio a legend in the childrens programming space told me shes the senior vice president of curriculum and content at sesame workshop meaning shes in charge of making sure that one of the most beloved and respected preschool shows is teaching its viewers the right stuff if you do you could extend the learning she said talk about or act out the story after watching thats when they learn use it as a springboard so whats our familys television philosophy now minimize screen time opt for boredom and ride out any impending tantrums in the hopes that building a magnatile castle or getting lost in a makebelieve world may engross our daughters for a bit when we just dont have the wherewithal we put on something nice slow and calm and we put it on a big screen to increase the chance we can enjoy it together during the pandemic did ella now five years old watch oklahoma so many times id often come across her innocently singing im just a girl who cant say no in the bathtub yes did i flagellate myself over it nope i just struck up a conversation about ado annie and regional accents and how she orta brush her teeth before bed sophie brickman is a contributor to the new yorker the new york times and other

women and girls are being subjected to an epidemic of violence that requires a radical and bold shift in how authorities in england and wales tackle crimes that disproportionately affect female victims a police watchdog has warned in an interim report her majestys inspectorate of constabulary and fire and rescue services hmicfrs calls for councils schools health and social care bodies and all areas of the criminal justice system to work together to address the problem as police cannot solve this alone in march the inspectorate was asked to inspect the effectiveness of police engagement with women and girls a number of recent cases involving violence against women and girls have raised the profile of such offending including the death of yearold sarah everard that of julia james a police community support officer in kent allegedly killed while out walking her dog and the murders of the sisters bibaa henry and nicole smallman in a park in northwest london in june among the inspectorates recommendations was a call for an immediate and unequivocal commitment that the response to violence against women and girls is an absolute priority for government policing the criminal justice system and public sector partnerships backed up by funding within this hmicfrs recommends that the home office and other government departments should consider proposing a statutory duty on partner agencies to collectively take action to prevent harm caused by violence against women and girls the police should make the pursuit of adult perpetrators of violence against women and girls and the disruption of such offences a national priority say inspectors and structures and funding should be put in place to make sure victims receive tailored and consistent support her majestys inspector of constabulary zo billingham said we are living during a national epidemic of violence against women and girls the prevalence and range of offending and harm is stark and shocking we are clear that the police have made great progress over the last decade against a backdrop of greater demand and we want forces to maintain this momentum and build on these improvements but there is still evidence of inconsistent support for victims and low prosecution rates offending against women and girls is deeprooted and pervasive in our society urgent action is needed to uproot and address this and police cannot solve this alone there must be a seamless approach to preventing and tackling violence against women and girls across the whole system including education local authorities health social care and those from across the criminal justice system with all agencies working together among shocking statistics highlighted in the report are the crime survey for england and wales estimate of million women experiencing domestic abuse in the months to march as well as the rape and other sexual offences recorded by police in which the victim was female in of cases the inspectorates final report is expected to be published in september with further details of the governments strategy on violence against women and girls anticipated later this year sarah jones the shadow minister for policing and the fire service said hmicfrss report is clear there is a crime epidemic against women and girls and fundamental systemwide change is needed to address it this is damming and sadly predictable after

sarah was attacked by her partner while she was pregnant she went to aampe but was afraid to talk about what had happened after her baby was born sarah gathered the courage to leave and talk to the police but before long officers told her it was too late she had passed a legal time limit she never knew existed and her ex would not be charged sarah was badly abused by her partner but she was also badly let down by the law today mps have the chance to change this to prevent victims from being denied justice or protection we need to seize it the problem for sarah and for thousands of domestic abuse victims and survivors across the country is that there is a sixmonth limit on prosecuting common assault so where victims need time to be able to report there is a real risk they will be timed out wont get justice and nothing will be done about the abuser who is free to hurt again this is a serious blind spot in the criminal justice system over the reality of violence against women and girls the time limit on summary offences such as common assault is intended as a way to keep the justice system moving by pushing recent straightforward cases through the magistrates courts so everyone can move on with an incentive on the police to gather evidence fast for tussles in the street between strangers altercations in the pub between acquaintances where the crime is reported straight away that can be fine but not for domestic abuse there are countless serious reasons why victims may not be able to report the assault straight away because they dont feel safe because the abuse and threats are continuing because they feel ashamed to talk about it because of coercive control even if it takes them just three or four months to find a safe way to leave a dangerous relationship to cope with moving home and settling distressed children or to find support before talking to the police this time limit can be quickly reached as a senior west yorkshire police officer said to me domestic abuse cases can often require digital forensics or medical reports adding further time to the investigation domestic abuse cases are often complex and the law as written in relation to summaryonly offences doesnt take account of such complexities that is why the law needs to change in theory some of these domestic abuse cases might be picked up by other offences repeated or serious violence can be charged as actual bodily harm abh where no time limits apply coercive control is now also a crime the trouble is that there are too many domestic abuse cases where either the police or the crown prosecution service conclude that the threshold for abh or the evidence for coercive control just arent met and that common assault is the only charge to lay that is what happened to sarah but then time runs out so the perpetrator is never prosecuted at all that is why i am putting forward an amendment to the law with crossparty support to extend the time limit on common assault in domestic abuse cases instead of only allowing charges within six months of the common assault taking place it would give the police six months from the point when the crime was reported it stops brave survivors of abuse being timed out on a technicality and it sends a clear message to perpetrators that they will not be allowed to commit these crimes with impunity the domestic abuse commissioner for england and wales nicole jacobs is calling for this time limit to be increased so the criminal justice system properly recognises the difficulties victims face refuge womens aid and the centre for womens justice are all campaigning strongly for this change in the law so too are victims and survivors from across the country in sarahs case there were other problems including weaknesses in the initial police investigation but at least if there hadnt been a time limit there might have been more chance of stopping the perpetrator in his tracks instead he was able to taunt her over the police failure to act he has faced no charge for attacking a pregnant woman and he is free to abuse again the government and parliament should not stand by while victims are let down in this way and while more lives are put at risk because perpetrators are never challenged or stopped this simple change means women who take longer to find safety will be given more time for justice mps should support it today yvette cooper mp is the chair of the home affairs select committee sarahs name was changed to protect her identity in the uk call the national domestic abuse

back in derry to see my dad and my old house still has that familiarly unfamiliar feeling of time passed and preserved this year will mark the point at which ive lived away longer than i ever lived there and yet i have a sense memory of this house and the surrounding fields and paths that feels eternally bakedin when my son pitches headfirst through its rooms or gallops over its garden fences i steady and swerve his body to avoid pratfalls and outcrops on which ive grazed myself a thousand times if these walls could speak theyd probably say mind yourself bloody hell i can trace a chronology of split foreheads carpet burns and sprained toes all the way from my old bedroom into the hall at the front where my brother conall and i played indoor football as i avert my son from colliding into the ft table in our kitchen i realise i know its contours better at childheight than i do my own even this doesnt really make sense i left derry as an yearold but my thoughts of this house remain fixed at childhood at the expense of the many and more recent years i spent here as an adolescent more things survive here from those years than my younger days as i discover when i find an aphex twin mixtape still occupying a slot in the kitchens dusty cd rack for the last few years i lived here i was the same height as i am now so why am i astonished at the low hang of countertops or that i can catch my reflection in the mirror that hangs high on the wall sometimes peering at that tired but devilishly handsome man in the mirror evokes the same bittersweet feeling of vertigo you get from visiting your old primary school as you stand ft higher than youre supposed to like some befuddled lemuel gulliver very little material evidence of my actual childhood remains my dad and my sister caoimhe have headed up substantial refurbishments so that few of the rooms look much like they did when we were growing up conall has overhauled the bedroom we shared so it now has a deluxe gaming

packet of weetabix as promotional tieins for s supernatural family romp casper its longer still since its walls contained the riot of noise that my entire person family generated from the steady outflow of older siblings to schools and jobs and lives elsewhere began but when we return were pleased to discover just how easily the noise of a toddler or raucous postdinner character

this week i happened to come across a particularly fascinating instagram post from a member of that strange and relatively new breed of people known as mumfluencers and it shows the aforementioned mumfluencer dressed eversocasually but with mysteriously perfect makeup marching through a forest with three small boys most intriguingly she is holding a letter board on which she has spelled out into the woods we go because kids wont remember their best day of television i have a lot of questions about this photo which has gone heavily viral in the us and the first one is this did she carry that letter board the whole time she was in the woods because that surely would have become a bit tiresome also are those actually her kids that has been the publics assumption but i also have three small children and let me tell you no way would the mother of those kids have the time or inclination to put on lipstick in the morning also maybe ive watched too many horror films of the midsommar variety but there is something about that photo that makes me suspect shes taking those kids into the woods to make a human sacrifice aww classic instagram moment the craziest thing about that picture is the message kids wont remember their best day of television has this person ever been a kid i absolutely remember my best days of television because television is bloody brilliant especially when youre a kid possibly the greatest afternoon of my entire childhood was when i watched the episode of mister rogers neighborhood in which he goes to the crayon factory i still watch it on youtube in times of stress the malleable coloured wax getting pushed through some metal holes and turning into crayons people are very into asmr videos these days those clips of smoke blowing or sap dripping all of which are said to provoke a soothing sensory effect in viewers but the greatest asmr video ever is mister rogers at the crayon factory apparently we did as a family go on walks in the woods because ive seen the photos but i dont remember any of that i do however remember the saturday afternoons when my sister and i would watch beverly hills baywatch blind date and gladiators now that was a great day of tv of course the message of this photo has nothing to do with television and everything to do with parenting and specifically performative parenting theres been a lot of it about recently especially during the lockdowns when some parents needed to prove to everyone that they were not merely parenting in this difficult time but parenting better than anyone ever has or will new linguistic rule when a noun turns into a verb eg to friend to parent it becomes more about outward show than emotional connection hence the rise in online photos of children snuggled up in a striped tent in the garden or frolicking in a bluebell meadow or lying on a bed with mummy looking up at the camera theres nothing wrong with children doing any of those things but are they inherently better than lets say letting your kids watch tv mumfluencers say yes but ill tell you what ive learned during my time as a lipstickfree woodsavoiding mother theres a lot to be said for loweffort parenting performative parents say lets all make a picnic and eat it in a nearby meadow loweffort parents say ill defrost a pizza then well eat it in the kitchen performative parents say lets have a scavenger hunt loweffort parents say lets watch bill amp teds excellent adventure if youre the kind of parent who can do activities without getting in a foul mood good for you i am not and my kids would rather do nothing and have a cheerful mother than a mother screaming about the impossibility of erecting a tent loweffort parenting is occasionally confused with socalled slummy mummy parenting that look at me im a crap mum my kids have no clean clothes i love gin shtick which is really just performative parenting approached from a different even more annoying angle loweffort parents by contrast dont have the energy for that kind of drama i love loweffort parenting but i am not saying it is objectively the best parenting because contrary to what lots of parenting books and influencers claim there is no best kind there is just parenting that gets you and your kids safely through the day without you putting anyone in the bin not every moment of parenting is an experience but i can honestly say some of my familys happiest moments have been when we have watched tv together everyone enjoying themselves all of us talking about our favourite moments afterwards no dread about the journey home because we are home true it may not get me many likes on instagram but at least i dont have to hold up a letter board,2021-07,week happened come across particularly fascinating instagram post member

after nine weeks of lockdown with her two kids a nineyearold daughter and fiveyearold son mara from alexandria in sydney has her weekly escapefromthefamily plan down to a fine art on saturday nights when my husband is home i go get takeout from three different places my son wont eat sushi my daughter wont eat fish and chips and i want what i want so three places it is she says cheerfully i walk instead of driving because it takes much longer and i make sure to have a glass of wine first so i can say it would be unsafe for me to drive all up a trip that should take no more than minutes stretches out to oneandahalf hours of blessed solitude and for mara the break is little short of lifesaving mara is just one of the increasingly desperate parents stuck in the new south wales or victorian lockdowns who has developed an arsenal of ways to carve out a tiny window of alone time when their kids are at home round the clock i spend as much of my day as possible shopping says motherofthree katelyn from sydney i went to get milk on one particularly heinous friday after homeschooling all three of them and spent twoandahalf hours walking up and down the aisles listening to music natalie from melbourne says the bathroom provides a blessed salvation i take showers for minutes and wash absolutely nothing she says just enjoy the hot water on my back in my selfmade prison others rely on work as an excuse i lie in bed surfing the net says craig from the nsw south coast he tells his daughters hes busy researching for his job as a writer ruby from northern nsw also works significantly less than her children realise i lock myself in the office and tell the kids i have an important zoom but really i put some real housewives on extended or even entirely unnecessary medical appointments are also a welcome escape hatch sophie paterson a motheroftwo from lake macquarie in nsw says she looks forward to the merciful relief of a doctor visit like a dying man finding water in the desert im currently on the way to donate blood paterson says i am salivating over the chance to read my book and eat snacks uninterrupted needles v kids no contest its the same for naomi chrisoulakis from the illawarra south of sydney oh no theres such a long line of cars ahead of me at the drivethrough testing centre she cries in mock horror of her visits to the local covid clinic adding that she carefully chooses the longest line turns up the tunes and blisses out mara also races for a covid test at any opportunity when nsw chief health officer kerry chant said a few weeks back that we need to stop getting tested for covid unless we have symptoms i felt personally attacked she says drily its one of the only times im away from the kids dr justine gatt from the school of psychology at the university of nsw says its vital parents grab whatever slivers of time they can to look after themselves when the pressures of fulltime parenting homeschooling working and the pandemic in general threaten to wear their resources thin the challenge right now is figuring out ways to boost our own wellbeing within the confines of our home with so little spare time to do it she says along with grabbing those brief moments of alone time she suggests parents look for ways they can make life easier on themselves such as going to sleep at a reasonable hour so theyre able to wake early for a sunrise walk or jog or trying meal kit delivery services to save the time and stress of cooking every day if you have a partner you could also organise a schedule where you each take on the parental load and give each other some time to do something you enjoy she says clinical psychologist dr judith locke says parents shouldnt feel guilty about leaving their kids to their own devices whenever the opportunity presents itself its important parents dont become julie cruise director instead making sure theyve taught their child to play by themselves occasionally she says even quiet time where everyone is in their room playing or reading quietly is a good idea headphones for children watching tv makes the space quieter for adults to regroup if all else fails advises seasoned childdodger mara keep the house in a complete mess so its easier to conceal yourself i spend a lot of time hiding under the doona she says its surprisingly effective because the whole house looks like

its finnish winter in complete darkness and its raining ice and then you cant sleep and the baby is screaming and youre too tired to get up but if you dont get up there is no one else there anna hrml is describing february when her partner walked out on her and their fiveweekold baby in order to remember she has to inhabit the brutal darkness of that time there was extreme tiredness a deep sadness moments of despair but also moments of great love and purpose that first year was a crazy rollercoaster it was absolutely she pauses and breathes in searching for the right word what is the word for how it feels when your partner has an affair and abandons you with a newborn how do you explain it hrml a finnish art teacher and childrens book author started drawing comics the comics are raw and funny and painful thrusting the reader straight into the moment of crisis hrml ravaged with tiredness contemplating the droopiness of her breasts and eyebags intimate conversations with friends snapshots of the messy loneliness of life stranded with a newborn the drawings feel so immediate that its easy to believe you are reading the story in real time yeah right as if a newly single mother desperately trying to survive would be likely to sit down each day and create beautiful narrative art about it in fact hrml posted her first single mothering comic on instagram in march six years after the birth and breakup when we speak it is summer and hrml now is at a cabin in finland along with her current partner his three kids and her daughter selma six it feels safe to revisit what happened she says im the happiest and most at ease with everything in my life for a long time i couldnt think about parts of it or talk about it some of it was too painful hrml and her expartner had been together for seven years the relationship was comfortable and safe hrml says but it had problems the communication wasnt good i was getting to the age that if you want to have kids you have to do it so the couple spent two years trying for a baby i think i had a feeling there was something wrong with the relationship but we had built a nest for the baby the thought of it ending it just couldnt happen after the baby was born her partner had a major freak out she found out he was seeing another woman i remember sitting on the bed with the baby and he was blurting it out and i didnt really believe it they briefly tried couples counselling but it was clear things were over she went into survival mode i was like a robot my body went through the motions i made sure the baby was dressed warm fed meanwhile my head was somewhere else in this dark mess you cant sleep you lose track of time everything around you is just floating but im privileged im from the middle class in a nordic country where you get free therapy and maternity pay so you can survive i saw a psychotherapist once a week for a year she knew exactly what to say and what i needed the routine became an anchor which kept her from floating completely adrift she also had family close by and friends stepped up i started reaching out to other single mums its a community youre instantly welcome i realised this has happened to a lot of people mostly women that fact is reflected in the eager appetite for her comics ive had comments on social media from people saying that they really need this says hrml i definitely needed something when i was alone with selma in the first year apart from in the us comedydrama gilmore girls with its close motherdaughter dynamic i didnt come across lots of depictions of single mothers that wasnt the singlemum victim in a crime show at the darkest points her tiny daughter became her compass choices were simplified it was easy to think what is the best thing for her to put myself aside but her own needs were still there that was one thing i felt was really unfair she says when you break up from a long relationship maybe you want to go partying or travelling for half a year you need to find yourself and feel your feelings but there was absolutely no space to feel my feelings so there was lots of crying and there was lots of walking she didnt keep diaries but wandered through helsinki taking photos of the places where significant things had happened her therapists office the building where she took selma for postnatal checks streets theyd walk down after the breakup there were so many weird things going on it was like opening the door to a completely new reality i knew i needed to tell a story about this but also i needed to survive so the story has been bubbling inside for six years and now its coming out despite the time that has elapsed the comics are packed with incredible detail in one hrml sits at the table in her dishevelled flat her eyes are blue bags of exhaustion her breast wrung dry from pumping a stray sanitary pad perches nonchalantly on her head through the phone a wellmeaning friend messages she is small for such a short time its important that you make the most of it the comic sweetly sums up the scourge of unsolicited advice offered to struggling new parents it also captures the isolation and chaos of new parenthood im amazed by the precision of her memory does she use creative licence in retelling the story it is the truth as i remember it as i experienced it she says it was such a strong devastating and traumatic experience that if i access these things they are still fresh she feels the years have been necessary if i had done the comics earlier they wouldnt have been funny they would have been mean revenge comics whats the saying tragedy plus time equals comedy its basically that was she inspired by other comic memoirs im not really this comics geek she says its more that comics are just what comes out when i want to tell a story in fact it was rewatching fleabag that gave hrml the voice she had been waiting for i was like ok now i know how to do this there was something about the fact that the show can be brutal and funny and painful i thought ill do that and see what happens what has happened is a series of comics which are laughoutloud funny as well as tender and moving some are purely visual like the fourpanel depiction of her ex bursting their cosy newborn bubble with his comically outofcontrol erection they explore hrmls struggle to marry two duelling identities new mother and newly single in one she goes on a disastrous test date where the guy starts leering at her enormous leaking boobs that happened she laughs afterwards i realised i had to finish breastfeeding before dating again she started dating properly when her daughter was eight months old i enjoyed it she says i was rediscovering myself i made a profile which was like artsy mum who has a woollen sweater and is not looking for onenight stands and i got to meet all the nice web developer dads in their sweaters it was good to talk to another adult thats whats missing when youre alone youre just talking to the baby and the wall many of her comics explore her shifting relationship with her body in one her breasts have become mechanical feeding equipment in another she laments how everything is completely reorganised inside im like a virgin again a virgin mother that was something else that seemed extremely unfair about being dumped so soon after giving birth your body has completely changed and yet you cant go to that familiar person whos safe you have to have sex with someone new although she is still angry about everything she went through she is determined not to trash talk her ex he has been a really good coparent hes been making up for it in that sense plus there is her responsibility towards her daughter i dont want to put anything out there that i wouldnt feel comfortable showing her or talking to her about has selma seen the comics she was asking me about the one with the huge eye bags whats the blue under your eyes oh theyre eye bags because mummy was very tired when you were a baby i was very very tired but i was so happy i had you and how about her ex i told him im going to make a comic book but now its on a bigger scale she laughs nervously i think he felt that he had messed up so badly its only fair i ask her if she feels vulnerable sharing it so widely i dont mind sharing the difficult brutal stuff she says i get more embarrassed showing the loving stuff of course there was a lot of joy and love with my daughter thats somehow more private that stuff is mine when hrml reflects on what she went through she has one regret i wish i hadnt felt ashamed she says but i did i felt like i had been lowered in the hierarchy of motherhood and parents society tells us we need to have a man and keep the man and that if the man doesnt want you you are unwanted in one of her comics drawn in the style of a medieval tapestry hrml appears as the single mother witch being chased out of the village with pitchforks its the perfect coupling of imagery and text does she still feel ashamed now i feel proud of what i managed to do she says my daughter is lovely shes doing really well i have a flat i have work i do everything myself i dont need a man i can be with someone if i want to but i dont have to and so ive gone from standing there alone with a child feeling ashamed to being proud,2021-08,finnish winter complete darkness raining ice cant sleep baby

coronavirus was weaponised by domestic abusers during the pandemic and police forces should remain alert to covid blaming as an excuse or defence by suspects a study has found the domestic homicide project established by the national police chiefs council npcc and the college of policing revealed that domestic homicides in england and wales had not increased dramatically during the pandemic but still remained at about three a week with recorded in the months to march this was similar to the previous years figure of and in line with the year average the project also found suspected suicides of victims with a known history of domestic abuse an average of three a month although this figure could not be compared with previous years as it was the first time the data had been recorded the report concluded covid had not caused domestic homicide but it had been weaponised by some abusers both as a new tool of control over victims and in some cases as an excuse or defence for abuse or homicide of the victim police and relevant agencies should be prepared for an increased risk of domestic homicides and potentially domestic suicides particularly intimate partner homicide and victim suicides as some abusers control is taken away by the easing of covid restrictions and other abusers regain access to victims the report said likewise police and other agencies should remain alert to covid blaming as an excuse or defence by suspects the firstofitskind study found the proportion of intimate partner homicide suspects previously known to police in the year to march was it found of suspects of all types of domestic homicide including killing parents and children were previously reported to police as suspects for domestic abuse in of all cases either the victim or suspect or both were previously known to an agency other than police such as childrens social services adult social services or mental health services the report concluded this suggests that potential domestic homicide suspects are more visible to police than previous studies have shown the npccs lead for domestic abuse assistant commissioner louisa rolfe said domestic homicide and suspected victim suicides are not something that only the police can try to prevent and were grateful for all the collaboration happening across the entire sector however as the report highlights there are still areas where we can improve both separately and by working together and this is especially important now that lockdown is over the evidence gathered by the project showed victims of domestic homicide were mostly

theres a game i play with my children that we never tire of in which i share details outlandish unimaginable of how things were in the olden days when i was their age most of their favourites are safety related no bike helmets no car seats no grownup in attendance when we walked to the shops a few of them are monetary the halfpenny sweet p from the tooth fairy occasionally its a food thing milk floats the horror of being denied a second dinner if we didnt like the first and of course theres a whole chapter on tech and rotary phones theres also a category of experience i dont share with my children because like smoking they would simply find it too shocking one of these is pe suburban schools in the us still lean heavily into competitive sports but that is not the case in new york at my childrens elementary school it is hard to imagine an event like sports day taking place in which unsporty children are made to compete and come last in front of the entire school there is an annual fun run organised for fundraising purposes at which kids trip over their own feet while running in different directions and like something from alices adventures in wonderland nobody actually wins they might play dodgeball in the gym but the kids themselves dont pick teams avoiding the spectacle of the same one being picked last every week the ugh sound from the team that ended up with them by default is a memory from childhood that never quite fades still i like competitive sports for girls particularly it makes sense to encourage strength and physical proficiency as a buffer against all the ways in which as they age theyll be encouraged to despise their own bodies i spent a lot of my teens competing at swimming and tennis and along with the confidence that came from winning learning that you dont die when you lose was a useful thing too it has been a strange experience therefore watching my sixyearolds at tennis camp this week where the sensitivities of the school system arent observed they have run actual races been allowed to compete one on one and had balls inadvertently thrown at their heads the first time my daughter lost she stood on the court looking baffled i felt silly she said after running to me on the sidelines and suppressing the urge to say get back out there and crush her i went through all the reassurances parents give in these situations losing is learning just try your hardest or i wont love you not really and the only aim is to have fun she trotted back happily enough and i felt the surge of an old chauvinism you dont get this from singing in a choir all of this comes at a time when professional athletes are pushing back against the tremendous pressures of competing at the top level simone biless sensible call to avoid potential injury by dropping out of an olympics final and naomi osakas withdrawal from the french open signify a reckoning by young athletes with their governing bodies that stands in contrast to older generations of female athletes caught up in campaigns simply to compete on the same terms as the men billie jean king whose memoir all in was recently published told the new yorker this month that while it might be tough to compete in the era of social media female tennis players had it worse when she entered the game before a womens professional circuit even existed no one was putting billie jean king on the cover of vogue in and no one was paying her much either the reason osaka made m last year is because of what we did years ago said king who made the point that while it was great that the womens tennis association was trying to help players with mental health problems pressure is a privilege if you want to be a professional athlete thats a choice you do not have to be a professional athlete for kids at school in new york any pressure is too much pressure with the exception of those entering the music world a friend whose child successfully auditioned for the citys special music school a hothouse for violin and piano prodigies where everyones a math genius too pulled him out after eight weeks and put him in mainstream school because they yell at them she said utterly scandalised it was like russia or something the gentler way is probably preferable in sports as in life at least for those not destined to be professional athletes but theres still room for competition at the end of camp every day the kids put their hands in the middle and led by their collegeage counsellors jump in the air and shout we love tennis they barely hit a ball but playing with stakes made them proud of

it was my wife who first professionalised things it took place in the common scuffle that kicks off around bedtime wherein our son insists on one more final book and inevitably reneges on the promise the second we finish issuing fresh demands for one more this stalemate has been a burden on our lives since he discovered that his will is usually stronger than ours the things my son stands firm on change by the day he likes mashed potato then he doesnt like mashed potato he doesnt like me and then he likes me a little tiny bit more but still not as much as his mother but it was the genius of my wife to formalise and interrupt these impulses by instituting the art of the handshake my son loves anything that allows him to act like a little adult this is often amusing in the sort of childwearinghisdadsshoes way i have to resist putting into this column every week because im aware of just how tedious it would become no matter how charming it is to us sometimes his adult cosplay borders on the offensive as when he bemoans the state of a mess he himself has caused in our sitting room by aping my wifes voice with a loud codirish exclamation of oh mgod look at dis mess this is incidentally the only bad irish accent weve ever allowed of an english person but luckily we hear it several times a day so at bedtime we now make him agree to one last book not with a cuddle or a plaintive plea but a handshake is this a deal we ask extending a hand he pauses for a while intuiting the honour bound up in such a ritualistic exercise before proffering his own and saying issa deal wed been looking for answers on how to get him to be a more amenable toddler in books and websites about child rearing we should have been reading the selfhelp tomes of donald trump deals have now spread to other areas will he get into his buggy for five minutes on the promise that he will be in a playground by the end of it issa deal will he stop putting his hand into the toilet to splash it about on the proviso that we will take him outside to jump in puddles issa deal he makes a deal before every meal every single tv show he watches and bath time too his entire life is now governed by the deals that bind our little corporate boss baby in a slew of hypothetical red tape one wonders what would happen were he to demand a paper trail we might have to buy a printer not that my sons ability to negotiate is anything to write in your companys quarterly report this is after all a person we convinced to eat mashed potatoes by telling him it was icecream despite the fact this would surely have made it the most disgusting icecream ever committed to modern cuisine he steadfastly ate every single bite since icecream any icecream was better than mashed potato were not always honest

i left having children pretty much as late as it was biologically possible to do and i quickly grew to recognise if not entirely understand a certain look lets say boredom mixed with condescension topped off with wry amusement sported by my friends who had their children at far more sensible ages when i would go on and on and on to them about the miracleslashinsanity of raising babies no one before me had ever noticed how crazy all this parenting stuff was i believed while looking uncomprehendingly at the smirks on my friends faces as their kids did their gcses well i comprehend them now because this is how i feel when people go on and on and on about the new dogs that they got during lockdown more than million people in the uk got a pet during lockdown and they have been especially popular among the unders this is generally reported in a tone of either shock what are those crazy kids doing tying themselves down to a pet so early or scorn silly snowflakes they cant handle a dog but i get it i took my time about having kids but i was precocious about dog ownership having decided at the age of that what was missing from carefree single life in manhattan was an extremely highmaintenance terrier who i could never leave alone in my tiny apartment because he would literally eat it i once came home from breakfast in my local diner to find that he had eaten half my sofa even though the sofa was ft long and my dog was the size of a jacket potato and because i was so derangedly in love with him i found this adorable and proceeded to bring him with me everywhere obviously you dont mind id say swanning into friends apartments with my yapping terrier and they looked at me as if id come in with a rat id found on the subway people got dogs during the pandemic because they were lonely and thats exactly why i got mine i was living on my own and working from home meaning i could go for days without interacting with another living creature except for the man who sold me coffee id thought this was what i wanted but i knew madness was setting in when i asked the fridge what i should have for lunch too many bad breakups had convinced me that relationships with humans were overrated and so i embarked on one with a dog id planned to get a female dog who i would call betty after my second most beloved idol golden girl betty white but when i went to pick up my pet a little runt of a male pup jumped into my lap he looked up at me with what i thought at the time was love but later learned was hunger and that was that i named him arthur after my most beloved idol golden girl bea arthur and for the past years he has been my constant companion well he has been more of a constant to me than i have to him because my life has changed a lot over the past decade and not always to his liking arthurs and my first years together were the halcyon years i was unquestionably obsessed with him i poured all the love i had to give into his stout and furry little body and he responded in kind years later i went to a comedy show in which the male comedian sneered about women who treat their pets like babies and even though i had babies by this point i felt such a sharp stab of loathing towards him arthur was never my baby but people love to love and if my options were him or that dickhead comedian which is how it felt when i was single choosing my dog was not tragic it was good taste you can always spot a sexist by their resentment of women loving things that arent men eventually i found someone who is not a sexist dickhead and we moved in together and arthur accepted that because it meant he got longer walks but then came the babies who terrified him at first because he thought they were eating me when i breastfed them then he just resented them because theyd pushed him down the pecking order when i brought the third baby home from hospital he met me at the door with a look that unmistakably said youre kidding right owning a dog

my youngest son is almost four so the sleepdeprived agony of newborn parenting has fully receded my sleep is no longer jittery and surfacelevel primed to be wrecked by the tiniest disturbance when i sleep now i expect to sleep then last month like a dummy i took my kids camping true i did everything to maximise the amount of sleep id get i booked a slightly upmarket campsite complete with actual beds and did some sums the sun went down late and came up early so my sons would wake up at the crack of dawn but if i drifted off when they did and everything worked out perfectly i could just about cram in six hours everything did not work out perfectly at am on our last night my youngest woke up in floods of tears he wanted his mum i couldnt blame him we all wanted his mum this hasnt exactly been a vintage period for anyone but my wife has had an especially rough ride she was already suffering from poor mental health when her mother died of covid in a care home miles away three weeks into lockdown like so many others who lost loved ones this way she found it impossible to find closure to her grief in all the fog of uncertainty additionally lockdown itself caused her agoraphobia which had left her housebound for much of her s to roar back with a vengeance to put it bluntly it was a breakdown she couldnt leave the house some days she couldnt leave her bed she was unable to work and started to speak darkly about finding inpatient care to prevent her from acting upon her worst impulses its a challenge to keep a young family running under these circumstances ensuring that the logistics of the house the shopping the laundry the school run the income continued while keeping the children happy and engaged aware of the broader situation without being overwhelmed by it took it out of everyone as a family weve been running on fumes for as long as i can remember so the camping trip ultimately served two purposes the first was to let the kids run around outside for a weekend the second was to give my wife some peace if it wasnt for the agoraphobia we would have sent her somewhere nice for a couple of nights instead a plan was hatched she would stay at home and have two days of uninterrupted quiet and we would set off on an adventure and it worked for a day and a half the trip went without a hitch the three of us chased one another around fields and visited zoos nobody wet themselves and everything was great but then on our final night the threeyearold woke up and started crying inconsolable violent tears that couldnt be stopped it was a newborn tantrum with the added bonus that he could now verbalise his anguish i want mummy he screamed well see her tomorrow i whispered no we wont he cried yes we will the sun will come up and then well go home and see her the sun wont come up we wont see her his older brother reached over the darkness and hugged him sleepily murmuring its going to be ok no it wont came the reply the poor kid had convinced himself that the night would last for ever that hed never see sunshine again i knew the feeling in the end i crawled into their bed and held him slowly after what felt like half the night had passed his screaming turned into sobs the sobs turned into murmurs and as his brother cuddled him from the other side the murmurs finally turned into sleep we all passed out as one clinging to each other for dear life approximately seconds later the sun screamed back into the air and everyone woke up again i took a picture as soon as we were awake and it is not particularly flattering we are all redeyed and exhausted and my face looks like its been pummelled with a hoof but i havent deleted it because it means something its proof that we got through the night and if we can get through that we can get through anything my wife didnt have the best weekend either without anyone around she found it difficult to get the rest she craved maybe a break wasnt what we needed maybe we need to start taking it slowly together as a family shes doing better by the way but its a long road back well get there for starters were going camping again before the summer ends this time she wants to

femicide the killing of women and girls by men is once again hidden in plain sight by the government a new violence against women and girls strategy announced last month fails to address the worst form of mens violence against women and girls their killing the same omission was made in the two previous strategies our end femicide campaigns first objective is to name it six months in to the campaign our government has failed women and girls at the first hurdle the murder of women in the uk has recently generated hundreds of articles and a mass outpouring of grief and anger so how come the government has failed to name and identify femicide if not now when what will it take sarah everard bibaa henry nicole smallman julia james balvinder gahir khloemae loy and libby squire are named in the strategys introduction by the home secretary priti patel other than references to highprofile murders nowhere in the document is femicide or even homicide specifically addressed seven pages of examples of trends in violence against women and girls fail to make a single reference to the total number of women killed by men a oneline reference to the number of domestic homicides to march is a statistic that does not even include five of the eight women named by patel it is absurd that the government chose to separate a forthcoming domestic abuse strategy from the violence against women strategy and it is not enough to hope that the killing of women and girls will be addressed in the new domestic abuse strategy while the majority of cases of femicide are committed by men within womens domestic sphere by a current or former partner by a son by other male family or partners family members of women were killed by men they knew outside of a family or partner relationship including friends colleagues and flatmates one in twelve were killed by strangers so over a quarter of all killings of women by men would not be tackled by a focus on domestic femicide and while we know that in some cases women kill male current or former partners only addressing fatal violence in the context of intimate or family relationships invites the failure to address sex differences for example we know that most women killed by current or former partners have been abused by them for months or years before whereas when men kill male partners it is much more likely that the killer is the one who has suffered prior abuse one of the main aims of the femicide census is to bring attention to the number of women killed by men in the uk we are part of the international efforts to draw attention to the ultimate act of violence perpetuated by men against women and girls we are not saying rape sexual harassment domestic violence fgm and stalking are not serious and that they are not all too often lifechanging but that surely the extinguishing of the very lives of women and girls cannot be overlooked for many men who kill women fatal violence is the endpoint an escalation of earlier uses of violence or coercive control an end point only because this is the time when they are stopped from inflicting further harm on women by incarceration sometimes mens violent actions and controlling behaviours have not come to the attention of the police the courts or other statutory agencies sometimes they have and responses have been inadequate opportunities to intervene have been lost sometimes men have killed and raped before theyve served sentences and been released while still a danger to women and then theyve killed and raped again chances to intervene are being missed let alone the failure to look at all at the societal causes of mens violence against women within hours of jake davison killing five people this week local mp johnny mercer was quick to echo the familiar isolated incident refrain saying that the incident was no longer ongoing and there was no reason for people to be afraid when on average a woman is killed by a man every three days in the uk we should not think about isolated incidents but look for connections and no one should imply that women have no reason to be afraid failure to view davisons killing spree within the context of femicide means that we do not look for the links between him killing his mother maxine davison and the nine other uk women we have identified with their son as the suspect in their murder so far this year in fact in the uk women who are mothers are more likely to be killed by a son than by a stranger the time to reframe our understanding of mens violence against women and girls is long overdue it is not just the government which ignores the killing of women by men when we talk about violence the interim report by the hm inspectorate which focuses on how effectively the police respond to violence against women and girls again names sarah bibaa and nicole but it makes no further mention of how the police handle the killing of women and girls the femicide census does not ignore dead women they all matter to us the ones youve read about and the hundreds upon hundreds you havent and wont the observers end femicide campaign is here to ensure that we honour the women killed and that we create an outcry so that those who have power to stop the killing are forced to act if the government expects us to believe that they are serious about ending mens violence against women and girls then surely they must have the conviction to name the most extreme manifestation of that violence,2021-08,femicide killing woman girl men hidden plain sight government new violence woman girl strategy announced last month

by the time we left the hospital hours after my son jules was born on july two nurses had commented on the strength of his suck four friends had written us some version of finally youve got your boy and even my female obstetrician had commented favorably on the size of his penis if you must know it had to do with the clamp used during his hospital circumcision i had already had two daughters but having a son somehow immediately launched me into new parenting territory on the phone between nursing sessions i told a friend how evenkeeled i felt in comparison to the first few days postpartum with the girls which i remember as a hormonal rollercoaster of weeping joyously at goodnight moon yelling furiously at my husband for forgetting diapers and spinning out about how i might crush my baby with my newly enormous bosom all within the span of an hour when youre carrying a boy there are higher levels of testosterone in your body she said this explanation struck me as so clearly unsound that i researched it and soon confirmed it as unscientific and misogynistic dreck my friend is a phi beta kappa graduate of harvard if such a dubious theory had been able to slip past her usually rocksolid bullshit detector how much was slipping past the less thoughtful among us surely this was just the beginning of what jules would hear as a male in our society the same kind of comments that likely helped make his father wildly overconfident as in so confident he once decided to man the grill at an offduty barbecue for michelinstarred chefs it can be an attractive albeit confounding personality trait and while i am thankful that the only thing my son is currently internalizing is breastmilk itll be just a matter of time before he starts picking up on his genders elevated stature when i broached the topic with friends who had older girls and younger boys i heard variations on a theme even at an age when a babys gender is about as visible as his pinky toe and even in an age when metoo and similar movements have put misogyny in the spotlight each had witnessed a very real preference for their sons my fatherinlaw only likes the photos on our shared family stream that feature our boy one told me the language we use hes the heir hes carrying on the family name these images of masculinity from when theyre so tiny its really frightening we also got a big penis comment on day one emailed another who noted the vast number of people who complimented her husband on finally getting his son but i also found a glimmer of hope in our older girlyounger boy triad one night before bedtime my twoyearold charlotte paused to bap her little brother her version of burp which involves a perfunctory wallop somewhere in the vicinity of his back more often than not his ear before asking that we build a castle for baby jules as i watched my daughters multicolored magnatile structure rise higher and higher around their brother i wondered if this was the key to raising a good son having him literally surrounded by castles built by his two strong wiser and older sisters even if he did occasionally get a tile to the face and when i spoke to dr susan m mchale a professor of human development and family studies at penn state university who researches sibling dynamics she allowed as much girls she told me tend to be more relationally oriented to the extent to which girls are better behaved their younger siblings are going to see that as a model and want to copy she said conversely some studies have found that brotherbrother dyads lead to an increase in risktaking behavior for the younger boy perhaps because the older one serves as a gateway into spending time with older peers and delinquent behaviors mchale is a firm believer that sibling relationships are unique and extremely important even though they are the least studied the amount of literature is much smaller about siblings even though its the most lasting relationship in peoples lives she said a lot of how things work out depend she cautioned on the parents if they favor one child over another or have higher or lower expectations learning how to praise each childs strengths goes a long way towards equity but when i told mchale that i harbored hope that jules was by chance alone in a prime position to end up with a welladjusted outlook on gender roles she offered up a highly unscientific example my own brother had three sisters and hes a fabulous husband and father she said his sisters take all the credit heres to hoping sophie brickman is a contributor to the new

my son has a new watch every weekday morning before school he declares its minutes until we have to leave now its and a half minutes until we have to leave its very relaxing i worry that this obsession with clockwatching is hereditary hes only saying out loud what im saying in my head my two main jobs broadcasting and djing share a central tenet to fill and manage time every day for two hours in a bbc radio studio i talk in time pockets backtime songs and declare what time it is to the nation im a timekeeping obsessive i know that i can use the bathroom make a cup of tea and be back in the radio studio in the time it takes for an average pop song to play out i know that it takes minutes to cycle from my house to work but if i hit every red light on the final stretch i know that it will take just over two minutes for you to read this article my time management is complicated by the fact that i thrive on being busy i pack my todo list neatly into my days like songs on a radio show my friend alice once read that jamie olivers time is divvied up into minute slots and she enjoys teasing me about doing this with my own leisure periods we once went swimming and i scheduled some time for floating after my two laps she wont let me live it down time is always ticking in my head sometimes when i ask people how they are i say give me the headlines as if im still on air and our talk time is counting down and of course my anxiety dreams are based on running out of time digits counting down on a cdj player while i frantically look for a song i cant find baying crowds that i cant satisfy running for planes and trains and boats that i miss at the last minute always time counting backwards recently i have been counting down my last radio shows for radio last week after years of clockwatching i left my job in broadcasting my final song has been played there is no plan my calendar is empty this is a new sensation a slowsliding panicky feeling a growing awareness of endless space i remind myself that this is not an anxiety dream this is not dead air i dont have to fill the space and for the first time in my adult life i dont want to i have left my radio job to give myself more time with my kids in the evening to put them to bed and eat dinner with them while they are still young i have also left radio so i can spend more time working on being a writer a job that involves sitting in a room by myself with a terrifying lack of structure i wonder how i will experience time now that im not so beholden to it when theres nothing to do i often suddenly feel anxious overwhelmed even i question the origins of my need to do things all the time my family are always very busy theres a plan for every holiday on christmas day our tradition is to jump into the sea in the morning and hike up the dublin mountains after lunch my husband thinks were all mad his parents can sit around and talk or read for hours without looking at their watches they relish being idle when they can the first time i went to his family home in sheffield for christmas the combination of tropicallevel central heating and a weighty dinner combined with a lack of plans meant that i fell into a deep sleep on their sofa i woke up dazed having dribbled over their cushions they were delighted that i felt relaxed enough to do that i was mortified i didnt recognise myself it went against every instinct relax is the mostused wordweapon in my husbands arsenal so im off the radio and the goal is to relax the school holidays are here there will no more morning countdowns from my son there will be no more producers in my ear telling me you have seconds left on this song i want to god forbid lose track of time i want to be one of those people who can slide into an empty day and float around in it like a swimming pool i want to stop being so aware of time running out of life hurtling by yes every day is just sand dropping in the egg timer of life but for heavens sake stop

my little son has a gang he roots for all boys dudes everywhere theyre his gang i figured this out recently when we sat down to watch the grand national hed picked a horse in the family sweepstake and his choice was out in front for most of the race when it fell back out of contention my son paled a bit possibly hed already spent the sweepstake winnings in his head on stickers sweets toy balls but he took the disappointment quite well i thought for a fouryearold the race was won in the end by a female jockey it was the only time a woman had ever finished first in a grand national the commentators shouted and all at once my son did cry real fat gushers instant snot moustache the works now this was too much if a girl had gone and beaten all the boys where does it come from i wondered this kneejerk allegiance that distances little boys from little girls and makes an usvthem of gender distinctions right from the getgo where does it lead as those boys become men these are questions ive been wondering about a lot as my son gets older hes a friendly curious kid who adores his older sister but his sense of himself just now seems to come across most clearly when he emphasises the contrasts between them along with millions of other little boys he will be coming of age during a richly complicated time for young men and i want to help him get this right the slow turbulence of the metoo movement with all its reevaluations and reckonings since harvey weinstein was brought to account for his crimes in then the sharp and terrible shock of sarah everards murder in the spring these events have helped adjust the way a lot of us price and make room for masculinitys expression in society there seems to be an urge to do things differently to rear young men without the same certainties and biases that previously we absorbed by rote mines not the first generation of parents to be thinking about all this and fretfully in the s the s the s the s the s there were many mothers and some fathers who looked at each other and asked what ought we be doing differently with boys perhaps whats new is the urgency a sense of enoughbeingenough perhaps whats new is that men in greater numbers are acknowledging the need for a rethink parents and those caring for sons have been wondering and wondering and wondering again if change is to begin with us how should a boy be raised now on the night of the disappointing grand national as i tucked my son into bed i found myself consoling him by offering up some pedantry about it being a successful race for women and men both actually the champion jockey was a girl but the winning horse was a boy well contented by that the lads having clawed one back after all my son fell fast asleep meanwhile i went to the computer next door to engage in one of those favoured activities of young parents troubled googling in went some of the jangly questions ive been asking myself lately queries picked off and transcribed as they circled around my head how to raise boy better what to tell son instead of stupid crap about male horses be better parent of boy create better man future the internet threw back all sorts howtos essays manifestos podcast episodes podcast seasons quickly i was watching the video of a speech delivered in by the novelist and activist chimamanda ngozi adichie coolly more or less irrefutably adichie argued that it was time to make feminists of the worlds young men feminism has to make a lot more room for the engagement with men of men about men otherwise were not getting anywhere she said the feminist boys have to get on board a few curious clickthroughs from there and i was reading the opening chapters of a book called how to raise a feminist son by an indianborn writer and academic called sonora jha i sent her a plaintive email how should i raise my son in and when she answered we arranged a phone call jha who now lives on the west coast of the us sounded relieved when she picked up even a little impatient as though shed been expecting me to telephone years ago so she said first im glad youre asking this question cos the time has come yknow traditional masculinity its not working i dont just mean for women its not working for our boys its not working for our young men i asked in what ways she thought so and jha gave the example of maskwearing during the pandemic long a contentious matter in her adopted country last year we saw donald trump make maskwearing about masculinity that has literally led to death misogyny homophobia these things happen when traditional masculinity veers into toxic masculinity now those who worship masculinity are also dying from it so yeah i think people are realising that something needs to change finally like adichie jha felt that one answer might be to raise boys inside a pronounced feminist value system that can be subtly done said jha who raised her son now in his early s as a single mother in all that time bringing him up i may have used the word feminism about three times it wasnt like i woke him up every morning and said here are the principles of feminism you will learn today instead it was allowing him to cry it was talking about how things may be uneven in the world towards girls raising him here in the us as a young man of colour he was being called to a certain kind of masculinity and he didnt necessarily feel comfortable around that for me it was an act of compassion towards him to introduce feminism not as a theoretical concept but as an everyday guiding principle in the way that we were going to lead our lives jha chuckled around the time her son left home she recalled she mentioned to him in passing that shed raised him to be a feminist and he said no no no i discovered it on my own i smiled to myself at that we spoke about her book which came out earlier this year she had given it a punchy title how to raise a feminist son and some men lashed out in response of course jha said some of them asked me why not just cut off his dick at birth somehow as a society weve come to believe this that a boy will be bullied if he is not the bully weve decided that this is how men will win whether that be jobs women leadership it doesnt need to be that way jha was sure a more equitable empathic social agreement would not only be better for girls but for boys too and what quicker route to get feminist principles into a young mans head than via the gate marked selfinterest its not just about raising gentle empathic boys its not just about explaining to those boys that there are certain structures preferable to men and we want to dismantle those structures its about explaining why we want things to be more equitable because if and when they are boys will get to be not constantly leaders but also followers they will get to fail they will get to spend more time at home in domestic roles and they can do all of those things without their very humanity being called upon without them being told you are less of a man because of this before we said goodbye jha suggested i try something with my own son that tearful episode around the horse race where he was upset by the success of a female jockey why didnt i make that a starting point for a different sort of conversation i think if it were my son i would say something like im sad your horse didnt win but how happy the winning riders family must be for her and the men who lost theyll probably work harder and be inspired by her so we get to be a part of her victory as well jha insisted that the only indispensable resource in raising awaketo alertto sons was conversation little and often others would say the same somehow i never quite got round to having that extra conversation with my son the right moment didnt seem to come actually anything may work as a prompt uju asika suggested asika the londonbased author of a parenting blog and the mother of two earlyteenaged boys explained how shed used video games hiphop summer football tournaments any kind of cultural resource to create a spur and get my sons thinking like i listen to my eldest playing video games with his friends theres all this banter you want to leap in correct criticise condemn but its been a learning process for me ive been trying to listen more and wait more and see where theyre coming from then i might ask why did you say that did you understand what it meant i try to challenge their viewpoints but at the same time accept that all this is just their experience asika sighed she was talking to me while her sons were at school one at primary one at secondary both fast on their way out of boyhood none of this has been smoothsailing its not like a tv sitcom where you sit down and have this amazing conversation that solves things on the spot actually asika added a tv sitcom had been a useful conversationprompt the other day weve been watching friends again just full of stuff you might um want to challenge this was an episode where ross was worried about his son playing with a barbie instead of a gi joe asika and her sons watching wound up having a profitable chat about gender stereotypes a quick chat when i go into lecture mode i can see them zoning out kids have really short attention spans but in a way i see that as something we can use to our advantage plant seeds was asikas suggestion to me and start small when you read the various statistics about boys male violence toxic masculinity all this it really does start to feel overwhelming like its a crisis point for boys and men i try to be more hopeful and see it as an opportunity to keep adding to their options the boys coming into the world now i hope as they get older theyre going to feel a lot more liberated as opposed to being fit into the boxes that have existed for generations of men the main thing is to expand the ideal of what we consider manliness to be last july as asika was preparing to publish a book called bringing up race about parenthood and racial identity george floyd was murdered in the us prompting a summer of global protest that was happening i was bringing out my book so we talked a lot about race and identity at home i asked my sons about their experiences as black boys we talked about how to behave in a situation for instance in an encounter with police or here in london especially any situation involving knives asika described them as scary conversations but necessary ones we get letters from school sometimes more muggings more incidents of knife crime i ask my sons what would you do if you came across this happening or if someone tried to steal your phone how would you respond she tried to help her sons expand their definition of manliness to include smart submission a phone is just property not relevant you hand it over and verbal instead of physical intervention walking away intact from a dangerous situation manly choosing words over fists manly asika said its one of those tricky wheredoyoudrawtheline problems between telling them to stand up for themselves not be victimised and at the same time not wanting them to become an actual victim because they stood up for themselves as a mother the main thing i want is for my sons to be safe but i do still tell them stand up to bullies stand up against racism stand up for what you believe in but does that necessarily have to mean a physical altercation does it have to mean fists cant it be with your voice with your values asika described it all as a workinprogress a lot of the parents i wound up speaking to used the same phrase as though we were all in the prototype stages of some great but wobbly experiment at the end of the day said asika mine are boyboys and always have been theyre still gonna be punching each other on the arm when theyre in their s you do wonder sometimes where it comes from danusia malinaderben a mother of from the south downs started to pick apart this question where does the boy in boy come from when one of her children came to her to say that he felt he was both a boy and a girl half of me is a boy and half of me is a girl was how he verbalised it malinaderben recalled he used a female name when not in school he wanted a dress id been lucky enough to have four sons in five years just a massive injection of boy and this moment triggered the most magnificent analysis of how i was being with my sons as a group i had to think what do i want to do with this i came across malinaderben via her two podcast series school for mothers and school for fathers in which she delves into aspects of an unconventional parenting experience and interviews others about theirs while we spoke she was workingslashhidingfromheryoungestkids in the car on her driveway how do we raise conscious boys in a changing world she wondered for years malinaderben has worked as a coach in maledominated corporate sectors talking to hundreds of men about their grief about having to be the strong one the leader the breadwinner the big guy at all costs an awful lot gets spoken about the privileges of masculinity particularly of white masculinity particularly white humans who identify as men we know those privileges well but the more that we narrow the range of activities and the stereotyped possibilities of what it is to be a boy and therefore a man we narrow the experience and expressiveness thats possible which leads to huge unhappiness ive come to see that men get thrust into channels of life that actually arent necessarily helpful for them and arent helpful for anyone else either the humanity that we disregard for males is a travesty we need to reinfuse our understanding of what it means to be male with humanbeingness her child was three years old when he first came to malinaderben with questions about his identity his preferred pronouns are now he and him it was a stroke of luck for me it really was i had the luck to reconsider things that i was doing with my sons that would also embrace and include his need i considered every element language clothing activities my conversation about what was possible in life career roles contraception consent she made sure to ask all her children the same questions about the future do you think youll be a parent yourself because its only girls traditionally who are ever asked that whenever she found herself at the foot of the stairs about to shout boys to summon the ones of her children she wanted malinaderben tried out other options fam team she shuddered at the cheesiness im still negotiating with them on that one for as long as id been researching this story i had been asking interviewees were there any small manageable free techniques of theirs that other parents might use malinaderben thought for a moment and came back with an answer i wasnt expecting blankets she explained when she considered at one end of her life the distress she was trying to counsel out of adult men and at the other end of her life the habitual and unexamined ways weve often raised our sons she noticed a gap boys were hardly ever taught to comfort themselves theres a whole industry of it surrounding women but its missing around boys selfcare for boys and men theyre told to channel it off into sports fishing diy just look at fathers day cards and the ridiculous things that dads are supposed to be into so malinaderben continued i encourage them to seek out blankets run themselves baths make a warm drink that sounds odd but theyve taught themselves with my guidance when and how to selfsoothe things we would once have associated with femininity wrapping yourself in a blanket making yourself cosy ive tried to help them do that without questioning whether or not its masculine otherwise im going to raise boys who are dependent on women to help them look after themselves many many women basically look after their men if theyre in a heterosexual relationship and the men rely on that as a kind of barometer of where theyre at emotionally its a disempowerment for men and its another thing that women have to do people told me of other interesting techniques mostly ones theyd stumbled upon while trying to secondguess or reimagine the work of raising sons in dave wilson a onetime handyman turned sobriety coach whom id contacted to ask for advice about the discussion of alcohol with young men said that in his own household he made deliberate use of the human habit of eavesdropping earwigging wilson called it hed raised one son to adulthood and now had two stepsons on the brink of teenagehood he realised he could get all sorts of useful information over to them about booze morals life without them squirming if he only staged a loudish conversation with his partner and let them hear it i spoke to a developmental psychologist from philadelphia michael reichert whose book how to raise a boy came out in paperback last year and who teaches a weekly emotional literacy class for young men in a school near his home reichert offered up neat parcels of insight on all manner of subjects that were pertinent to the development of young men for instance online pornography which the world of boyhood is steeped in he said whatever the topic though reicherts advice for parents boiled down to a oneword instruction i would say to them think about the day you just spent how many minutes did you listen to your son not ask him questions not interrogate him how many times did you sit back still your own thoughts mobilise that place in your heart where you are delighted in him really make him the object of your attention and listen in his weekly highschool class reichert said he had forced himself to stifle his own generational discomfort and listen to the assembled boys talk about their experiences with online porn this industry that is ubiquitous in their lives shaping what boys imagine is expected of them defining the boundaries of performative sexuality maybe in spite of whats hardwired in their natures i am way way more inhibited on this topic than they are im so much more uncomfortable theyre ready to talk about it theyre so happy theres this space in which they can acknowledge something to one another that there hasnt been much breathing room for at all oh one more tip reichert added try swimming on the floor excuse me i said its another strategy i recommend following the boys lead reichert explained that he has a grandson who is four years old the same age as my own son im looking after him ill plop myself next to him do whatever the hell he wants to do and for my grandson right now that involves pretending were swimming on hardwood floors this is miserably uncomfortable for me by the way but for him it means he has an adult who is willing to do what he cares about he doesnt have to do it alone he has me with him i have a daughter as well as a son shes a little older than him i find it easy and exciting to tell my daughter as often as i can you can do anything you can be anything ignore anybody who says otherwise not so straightforward when it comes to sons a pep talk about their future the kind where your instinct as an adult is to try to make the life ahead sound less complicated and cluttered than it will actually be sounds clumsy without certain disclaimers the disclaimers themselves sound clumsy it must all be so hard for a little boy to take in you can do anything but not anythinganything you can be anything only please hold back exercise judgment read rooms ignore anybody who says otherwise really really dont there is much thats cramped odd scary and foolish about inwardlooking male culture a lot thats good as well for years ive resisted it and been drawn to it a dozen men arranged in a semicircle to talk at volume about her and her and her and the match for the same person that can be shameful in theory and in practice as pleasurable as a deep bath my son enjoys taking me aside from my wife and daughter to tell me conspiratorially we have willies for many of us its innately felt this lure of one of the biggest clubs there is male kinship is sticky like a religion seeded early enough its tenets can be hard to shake off even when reason insists they must be i want my son to know that rewarding membership of the tribe neednt be rideordie it neednt mean allegiance above all else right after sarah everards murder in the spring as the country reeled in shock there was a muted but real reluctance among the men i knew to take any collective blame for one guys intolerable act it took about a week for the bigger idea to get across to me at least men as a tribe must hold themselves to account interrogate one another and curb one another if not because all men have the hidden potential to be awful and violent womenhaters then because the haters among us may be so lost in contempt they can only be reached by male criticism male pressure male example if the perpetrators of sex crimes arent being reached or punished by the law as it exists perhaps whats left is for men to be better policed by their peers when i spoke to the author uju asika about the aftermath of everards murder i was struck by her candour about her husband who felt the same initial responsibilityreluctance as i did asika called it that whole notallmendothis pushback which became very frustrating for me and a lot of my female friends speaking with my husband there was a sense of him trying to distance himself from a man who would do this type of thing i believe theres absolutely a chasm between my husband and the type of man who would attack sarah everard but theyve also both grown up within a system that is weighted against women hes had to recognise that hes had to say ok i have to be personally accountable for how i behave within the system how i relate to other men how i hold them to account posteverard a lot of grown men have been going about this business of slow extraction gloopily removing their feet from tacky alliances putting aside all the omert s wondering just what weve let happen to malekind on our watch especially out on the fringes imagine i thought after speaking to asika if we could raise our sons to think so clearly from the start no extrication or reeducation necessary and above all no sudden shocking murder as a prompt i see parenting as an act of social change bobbi wegner told me when we spoke by phone one afternoon a clinical psychologist and a harvard lecturer she has two sons aged and young men who in wegners candid phrasing are positioned to be the future dickheads of the world quite honestly theyre white theyre privileged ok none of thats their fault but they do get sent a specific set of messages from the culture that the world is theirs for the taking and i want them to appreciate and understand this its such a huge piece of the pie i want them to have an awareness of their position and use it it wasnt enough to raise boys not to be dickheads wegner had started to think better if they grew up antidickhead better if they ushered in a postdickhead world wegner described for me her radicalising moment as a mother of sons in the st century it was harvey weinstein was happening i had the radio on and they were talking about his crimes my son was in the room wegner as a teacher sensing a teaching moment stopped herself from switching off the radio and instead she began to explain to her son what weinstein had done how this rich and famous guy touched women when they didnt want to be touched how he said things that made them feel unsafe my son took it in didnt bat an eye then said what thats illegal didnt president trump do that wegner reeled back like woah woah woah did he think that all this was permissible it made me realise he was getting messaging that i just had no clue about and if i hadnt asked him or brought it up that day maybe it would have kept baking into his identity she hit the harvard library hard reading all the research she could and reaching the opinion crystallised in her book that was published last year called raising feminist boys that it wasnt enough to teach girls to protect themselves boys had to be taught not to harm wegner told me what we know about sexual assault is that a lot of it happens at highschool age and college age roughly to when boys frontal lobes arent even developed yet we have all these boys whove been seeing sexual content in puberty theyre really excited to get naked with girls they dont have a lot of rules about and parameters around whats ok and not ok sexual assault can end up happening as a kind of crime of impulsivity a lack of empathy a notknowing wegner felt sure that if these were drivers of a certain type of sexual assault these things could be tackled and perhaps eradicated with something as cheaply and readily available as conversation at home as a parent of sons wegner said she had settled on a programme of curiosity small provocative questions helping them to notice and wonder about things and a determined unsqueamishness when it came to any discussion of sex quite honestly its a workinprogress she said that phrase again i have my sons sitting in my living room now looking at me what to say to them today she wondered and tomorrow and after that all i know is that this is tied together she said sex relationships identity power differentials this is happening to them so as a parent you can either decide to turn a blind eye and see what happens which seems like too much of a gamble to me or you can appreciate that this is the reality and you can be in the passenger seat beside your son as they go through this stuff every parent of boys i spoke to for this story stressed at some point or other the same thing they didnt have the answers they only felt as though they were starting belatedly to ask better questions they were uming a lot ahing hoping for accidental insight between the sighs and the tuts and the headscratching it was a comfort to me that nobody knew anything for sure as i walked my son home from school last week he was idling along holding my hand softly singing one of those repetitive playground rhymes that kids spread among one another like ailments boys always win he chanted girls in the bin surely there was a composed ameliorative justright response that would get my son questioning this sentiment i said to myself think fast in the end i murmured a lame riff on the chant one in which everyone won nobody went in the bin my son looked at me when i was finished quite plainly thinking jesus mate theres no way that will catch on in my playground but he kept holding my hand as we walked i took it as a sign he was willing to be steered and that that was still my job however hamfisted or clumsy the effort

im straining to name a dragon and coming up short my son is looking on impassively beginning to lose respect for me storytime with my son has always been one of the true joys of parenting but increasingly its becoming one of the only such pleasures the hormone swings of toddlerhood have made him more shall we say spirited for the past few weeks read quite often just short of unbearable so time spent in his special chair poring over his favourite books has taken on greater significance both as a necessary top valve for his tantrums and a reminder that he does like us at least some of the time and that is something which is often now in doubt my son has taken to viewing us less as beloved parents and more as bitter enemies few of the old favourcurrying treats still work cuddles are denied his favourite foods rejected like poison even when angrily demanded just minutes earlier getting him to leave the house is now a daily or twicedaily chore placing him in a pram is like trying to force a horse into a pizza oven if you were to pass us on the street some sunny saturday him screaming me sweating as i remind him that hes going to his favourite playground youd be forgiven for thinking id kidnapped the poor child minutes earlier and was now taking him to a junkyard to be compacted but throughout this time the promise of a book has still been enough to soothe the savage beast transforming him back into that polite little cherub we know still exists in there somewhere his most recent favourite is one in which a pigeon must find the misplaced glasses of the irish president michael d higgins a perfect fit for a childrens picture book since he already looks speaks and acts like a character from a childrens picture book that was until last week when suddenly the appeal of the written word itself began to pall and my son pushed even his most beloved favourites away demanding no read a story from you daddy for a moment i thought he meant one of my wonderfully diverting newspaper columns renowned for their moral clarity and gentle humour but before i could reach for the stack of observer mags i leave prominently displayed around my home it became clear he meant that i make up a story for him on the spot a practice he still calls reading because hes not particularly clear on the rudiments of written language ive always made up stories for him but hes never preferred them to the real deal the idea that one of my stories would take precedence over a real book let alone our lovable cartoon president thrills me once upon a time i say in a clever opener im sure ive just invented myself before long his eyes are lighting up as i spin a killer yarn involving knights dinosaurs various members of paw patrol and a dragon a dragon called daddy my son

by all accounts dear evan hansen has plenty of problems to contend with transplanted to cinema from its tonywinning broadway run it has been battered by critics for everything from its overlong runtime to its wretched writing to its tonedeaf plot but nothing has set peoples teeth on edge quite like the sight of yearold ben platt playing a teenage boy in fairness the casting choice does make a sliver of sense on paper platt began playing evan hansen onstage in but he was years old then and so it wasnt completely unthinkable that he could play a handful of years younger the film however is a different story on camera which is always much less forgiving than the distance of a theatre seat he is clearly much older than everyone else in his school add this to his twitchy mannered twodimensionally outsidery performance and dear evan hansen suddenly takes on a sinister new bent watch the trailer alone and you could be forgiven for thinking that its a film about a dangerous pervert with a pathological desire to pose as a child or a grown man hired by the government to infiltrate a school and tacitly teach the students about the lingering spectre of death if anything platts performance is concrete proof that adults need to stop playing teenagers as soon as possible if youve seen hulus pen youll know what im talking about the series in which maya erskine and anna konkle play adolescent versions of themselves attempting to navigate high school recently aired an animated episode at the time i pegged it as my favourite of the series so far but then i went back and thought about why it was because erskine and konkle were only voicing their characters rather than dressing up like schoolgirls and acting them out seeing two women in their mids pose as children especially in scenes where they have to be romantic with actual children is a hell of a hurdle to clamber over if it were simply a cartoon all the way through im sure many more people would be willing to try it look hard enough and youll be bombarded with less egregious examples sex educations eric for example is supposed to be years old however the actor who plays him ncuti gatwa is just weeks away from his th birthday mindy kaling once congratulated herself for casting a teenage actor as the lead of her netflix sitcom never have i ever that said her yearold love interest is played by darren barnet who turned in april and then theres stranger things the first season derived all of its charm from watching an excitable band of tweenagers cosplay their way through nostalgic scifi tropes but they all got the job six years ago when they were actually young technically just months separates the first and third season of stranger things but the cast aged four years in that time by the time season four arrives next year caleb mclaughlin will be pushing with the rest of the cast in hot pursuit so what happens do they play their age and destroy the central theme of the show or do they go full ben platt and pretend that the ageing process can be halted in fact stranger things is a very good example of why adult actors are often used to play teenage roles on tv your teenage years are a highly volatile time when your face body and voice can change again and again in a matter of months by the time youre in your s that has all settled down so theres a case for arguing that a young adult will make a more consistent teenage presence than an actual teenager but dear evan hansen isnt a tv show its a film and a film filled with actors who are visibly much younger than ben platt perhaps the film could have gone down the grease route and just filled the entire school with transparently adult adults to lessen the shock olivia newtonjohn was when grease was filmed michael tucci was stockard channing was and it worked sort of because everyone was that age if theyd stuck an actual yearold in there for fun staggering around in abject terror because all their schoolmates suddenly looked like their parents then the jig would have been up but they didnt because theyre not stupid dear evan hansen meanwhile has done the opposite there are loads of children and then a disastrously deaged adult hoofing around in the centre of them looking like somebody has tried to draw a human face on a thumb its horrible still at least platt has a way to go before he catches up with the weirdest ever adultasteen performance in screen history barbara streisand was when she played a yearold girl in yentl perhaps platt can match her by holding on and revisiting the character in dear evan hansen the ickening,2021-09,account dear evan hansen ha plenty problem contend transplanted cinema tonywinning broadway run ha battered critic everything overlong runtime wretched writing

i want to talk to mummy my son bawled as i picked him up from nursery whats the matter pet i replied but he insisted this info was for her and her alone my son experiences a range of emotions at pickup time first the ecstasy of seeing me arrive to the door his arms outstretched as he sprints into my arms this i say in full awareness it might make some of you gag with schmaltz is the highlight of my day a sincere little ginger love bomb that never gets old im less enamoured of the second phase of this pattern which happens roughly half the time his immediate realisation that his mum isnt there and a battery of questions about her whereabouts my sons confusion on this point would be easier to understand if it were not me and solely me who drops him off and picks him up every single day but then again we are talking about a child who still sometimes looks round the back of the tv to get a reverse view of whatever show hes watching i thought little of his maternal demands until we got home and he ran into my wifes arms his bawling which had ceased almost immediately after we left nursery and embarked on our minute trip home was now redoubled in earnest with heaving sobs pulling his mums ear close he told her phillip pushed me with the horrified air of someone who had just been attacked by wild dogs we were aghast both of us recoiled at the thought of our boy being pushed by another child and me specifically since i was saddened that he didnt tell me in the first place i can rationalise the fact that my son feels the need to confide in these kinds of things to his mum but i find it hard i grew up without a mum so my father was our only port of call for all such dramas a situation im sure he relished as the sole parent of children perhaps im expecting my son not to play favourites because its not an option i ever had or perhaps it makes me insecure about how i present to him as his dad i think the idea of me being too stern or austere for such interactions stretches credulity a little i dress basically like a toddler and make poo and bum jokes for which my wife often tells us both off as a duo so perhaps i lack authority maybe my son didnt tell me because it would be like going all the way to a police station to report a crime only to deliver your witness statement to a traffic warden in the end we calmed him down with some strawberries and told him he was free to tell us both of us anything that upset him from now on the following day on being picked up he told me with delight that phillip hadnt pushed him today at least i laughed thanked him for keeping me informed and hoped some progress had been made wheres mummy he replied did ye hear mammy died by samas oreilly is out now little brown buy a copy from guardianbookshop at follow samas on

women who have suffered domestic abuse have described feeling ignored by police whom they accuse of failing to protect them from violence on the day a police watchdog said that preventing violence against women and girls should be considered as much of a priority as counterterrorism women told the guardian that they had been left feeling scared and vulnerable after interactions with the police a report from her majestys inspectorate of constabulary and fire amp rescue services hmicfrs found a staggering variation in the way domestic abuse was dealt with across police forces in england and wales adding that while the response had improved in the past five years there remained problems unevenness and inconsistencies in dealing with the epidemic of violence against female victims in the uk louise who left a violent relationship after seven years said that she was subjected to emotional physical and sexual abuse the response of the initial force who dealt with her case was absolutely amazing and they supported her in getting a nonmolestation order in place which prevented her ex from contacting her and being within a certain distance of her home but she said that after moving to a house in a different county to start a new life that support and feeling of security evaporated when her ex discovered her new address and posted it online she called the new police force but said the officers who did eventually come to her house were rude and dismissive telling her there was nothing they could do she later found out the officer had claimed he had called her solicitor which was untrue she claims they later apologised to me and said he had just started his shift and hadnt read up on historical notes it was completely unacceptable because me and my children have had these orders put in place to safeguard us and if the police are not going to act then the orders are not worth the paper theyre written on after a further breach her ex was arrested and released without charge but louise said she was not notified and when she called the force they would not give her any details about his release from a station close to her house she called the force who had put the original nonmolestation order in place and said the officer was shocked he said it would take anybody to look at your paperwork and historical events to know how dangerous this man is he couldnt believe it she said farah nazeer the chief executive of womens aid said that a postcode lottery still exists for too many women who experience violence and abuse the end violence against women coalition said the reports claim of vast improvements in police responses was not the reality for many black and minority ethnic victimsurvivors about whom there was a dire lack of data angel a yearold survivor of domestic abuse said she had reported physical abuse by a former partner to the police last year but had no contact from them for six months finally an officer told her that her original report which had taken five hours could not be found when she gave the details again she was told the incident qualified as common assault and as six months had past it had gone over the time limit and could not be prosecuted in more than twothirds of the cases examined by the hmicfrs report it found no evidence that victims had been referred on to support angel said she was given no signposting to anyone who might be able to help i was told nothing could be done for me i was left with no support i was left with no advice she said my abuser knows that ive made this report and just basically been left on my own to deal with it abbie now described reporting stalking when she was she said the community liaison officer called by her college to deal with the situation was visibly irritated with her i could tell that he didnt consider stalking and street harassment to be an issue she said he didnt even tell me how to make a statement his objective was just to minimise it and discourage me from pursuing it he said the police would be snowed under if they pursued cases like this names have been changed in the uk call the national domestic abuse helpline on or visit womens

preventing violence against women and girls should be considered as much of a priority as counterterrorism county lines and organised crime a police watchdog has suggested the comments came as a rootandbranch examination by her majestys inspectorate of constabulary and fire amp rescue services hmicfrs found problems unevenness and inconsistencies in dealing with the epidemic of violence against female victims in the uk the watchdog said the police response to such offences and victims has improved in the last five years but said there remained concerns including the staggering variation in the way domestic abuse was dealt with across police forces in england and wales asked whether violence against women and girls should be treated by police equally to counterterrorism zo billingham hm inspector of constabulary said these are very different crime and the tactics for preventing and disrupting these crimes are very different but it is undeniable if we look at what policing priorities are those crimes you have mentioned county lines counterterrorism serious and organised crime some forms of child abuse as well those are priorities within the polices strategic requirements violence against girls is not highlighted specifically as a priority within the strategic policing requirement the only real signal the government has to state what its priorities are we think it should be highlighted in there so that translates to an understanding at local force level that the government really means business about this that not only is there the expectation on forces that they will treat this as an utmost priority but the government itself will also review and consider progress the forces are making too pressed if this meant violence against women and girls should be treated on an equal footing to counterterrorism billingham added they should be afforded a priority that is equivalent to those types of crime although of course the way they would be dealt with would be different the inspector pointed to data that shows approximately three out of four domestic abuse cases reported to the police are closed early without the suspect being charged inspectors uncovered huge discrepancies in how they used the domestic violence disclosure scheme dvds known as clares law to provide confidential information about a persons criminal history to someone deemed at risk of future abuse the inspectorate found that about half of right to know dvds applications made proactively by police in england and wales in the year ending march after concerns about a persons criminal history resulted in disclosure to a potential victim and less than two in five of right to ask dvds applications by concerned members of the public such as partners of potential suspects resulted in disclosure although this can sometimes be attributed to the absence of any information to pass on the hmicfrs report was commissioned by the home secretary priti patel after the killing of yearold marketing executive sarah everard near clapham common in south london in march speaking to sky news the environment secretary george eustice said obviously priti patel will now look at these recommendations but i think this report does highlight some differences between police forces i think in these sorts of situations violence against women is a serious problem domestic violence has also been a problem for some time now what we really need to do is learn from those police forces that are addressing this well and i think the report highlights that some of them are doing far better than others and actually try and replicate those approaches that work in parts of the country in the uk call the national domestic abuse helpline on or visit womens aid in

how can i stop my sons meltdowns at the swimming pool the dawning realisation of my limitations as a parent came in the aftermath of another preswimming meltdown my son was approaching four at the time but still swam like a baby that might sound harsh but i mean it literally he was still in the parent and bub class splashing alongside sixmontholds whats more his stubborn resistance to the class was growing by the week we had tried seemingly everything lots of cuddles reassurance rewards then one day out of desperation as much as anything i tried something radical listening to him why dont you like swimming mate i asked i just dont like it he said and so we sat there on the living room floor where id been trying to cajole him into his togs and instead talked for once i managed to resist the urge to reach for my standard refrain youre alright mate and instead just empathised we talked about what it means to feel nervous about situations that make daddy nervous and that its ok to feel nervous but it doesnt have to stop you from doing something either it was his best week at swimming for months this lightbulb moment soon led me to complete an online course in emotion coaching children lesson one was humbling as associate professor sophie havighurst detailed how you can be a warm handson parent while still being emotionally dismissive of your kids ways of being emotionally dismissive include rushing too quickly to offer solutions using distraction to deal with kids unpleasant emotions or forcefeeding them positivity in an attempt to stop them dwelling on negative experiences essentially its about not recognising or acknowledging the emotions that like all of us drive behaviour like a stereotypical man i tend to reach instinctively for solutions in the face of difficult emotions as a natural tendency this makes sense i dont like seeing my kids upset and so seek to quell the negative emotion as soon as possible this ive realised makes me feel better but isnt necessarily the best approach for my kids much as i might wish otherwise anxiety anger and sadness will be part of their lives its important they come to recognise these emotions and in particular know that its ok to feel that way havighurst defines emotional intelligence as being able to understand your own emotions to recognise other peoples emotions to be able to regulate your emotions and manage them when they come up so that they dont overwhelm you she points out they are crucial building blocks for a childs development kids with good emotional intelligence are the ones who are better able to manage their emotions when they encounter challenging things at school friendship conflict other really intense experiences they might have she says as i learned sitting on the living room floor the crucial thing is to validate your childrens emotions of course this sounds blatantly obvious in theory but in the mad scramble of working parenthood can be deceptively difficult not to mention during covidinduced homeschooling it doesnt help that childrens worries can seem so trivial by adult standards we know theyre nothing to worry about so forget to stop and consider how real they might feel to our kids probably the simplest and hardest tip havighurst has is simply to slow down dont rush to judgment solutions or even to step in and stop sibling arguments this last one in particular i found hugely challenging nothing upsets my parenting equanimity more than the sound of my kids arguing havighurst has a different take children actually learn a lot from fighting its not a bad thing she says while of course setting limits around physical aggression this is their training ground for how to be assertive how to listen how to take someone elses perspective how to negotiate perhaps my biggest outtake from the course was to realise just how much of my parenting was done on autopilot instinctive reactions are inevitable and also necessary if you want to get other stuff done occasionally but it does help to learn how and when to slow down park the automatic reactions inspired by either a lack of time or your own upbringing and instead empathise and reflect emotions back to your kids first and foremost,2021-09,stop son meltdown swimming pool dawning realisation limitation parent came aftermath another preswimming meltdown son wa approaching four time

daddy you workin my twoyearold daughter asks throughout the day as my husband saunters around the living room in a fugue state conducting backtoback business calls airpods locked and loaded eyes fixed to the middle distance charlotte turned one a couple months after new york city entered pandemic lockdown so for the majority of her life her parents have been around worklife boundaries are so blurry that unless dave removes his airpods which he rarely does during most daylight hours whether or not hes on a call she assumes hes doing da business as she calls it when she wants to get his attention like when hes say talking passionately about robots who mow the lawns of commercial spaces and not reading her the book yummy yucky shell occasionally take his airpods out of his ears put them in her own backwards so she looks like shes trying to commune with little green men then walk around the room saying nice to do da business with you its good comic relief and a model of how to diffuse tension far more charming than my tactic which is to speak very loudly and tell him that if he uses the word leverage or ideate in my presence one more time ill ideate a way to leverage him into another apartment as we head into yet another pandemic fall with companies scaling back inperson work weeks and the future of office culture uncertain i wanted to understand better both a why it was so annoying to overhear his conversations and b what i could do to tune them out so that i could continue my own remote work were all multiple selves the couples therapist and psychologist signe simon tells me when i reach her on the phone theres work dave husband dave father dave it can be very shocking to encounter a person youre unfamiliar with especially if we dont like that version so thats part of the reason that hearing him geek out about robotic lawn mowers might make me judgmental or anxious it can cut another way too simon adds some people see their partner whos usually quite passive in a romantic context suddenly be really confident on the phone its like wait why am i not getting this sexy confident person at home but theres also an issue that arises from the premise itself overhearing just one side of a conversation when i speak to veronica galvan a professor of psychology at the university of san diego she reminds me that mental multitasking really isnt possible particularly when it involves the auditory system you cant just close your ears the way you can your eyelids in she released a study about cell phone use which indicated that listening to one side of a conversation can be more distracting annoying and have a more consequential effect on memory than hearing both sides of a conversation going on around you one explanation might be that additional attentional resources are needed to understand the unpredictability of a onesided conversation as a powerless bystander you dont know whats coming next and so your auditory networks perk up her practical advice is either to drown dave out with headphones or if were going to be in close quarters to find tasks that are less mentally intense since cognitive psychology suggests multitasking is slightly easier if the two tasks are very different typing on a computer and having a conversation both of those tasks are verbal she says talking to someone on the phone and looking at a map one task is verbal and the other is spatial so if my verbal resources are in effect saturated by his conversation i should do something less verbal in his presence which i point out is challenging given my line of work writing down words to form sentences but even if my work werent largely verbal galvan posits there may be something specific to this period that is making it harder for all of us to tune others out in our normal daytoday lives were in numerous different situations and locations she mentions an article that argued that it was harder to make memories during the pandemic perhaps because were all stuck in one location with everything running together and no specific interactions or events to delineate moments maybe these conversations stand out even more than prepandemic because now our brains are saying aha finally theres something different she says everything has been happening in these four walls and here is something unusual and im going to latch on to that her advice do anything that will break up the day take a walk do some stretching cook a meal to provide new context which will help improve attention and memory and minimize the postbreak interruptions for poor dave why not you may rightly point out just ask dave to confine himself to one place out of earshot and close the door like of other remote workers when i broach this with him he claims that his state of flow is better if hes constantly moving forward like a shark cool instead of engage i decide to take a tip from galvan and head out i return to find charlotte doing her little green men outreach

school started again last week but i was so dazzled and desperate i got the day wrong new uniform was laid out catlike on the bed work was stacked until evening in halfhour blocks and then the cold light of wednesday morning arrived shaking its head an inset day so once again the toddler was forced into an extended nap and the sevenyearold was handed the warm tv remote and i sat on the stairs next to my headache for a minute to catch my breath theres a video going round where a new zealand politician is interrupted during a live tv interview by her son who is wielding a phallic carrot i paused on her face chuckling exasperated as she tries to bat him out of the room then looked in the mirror to check my own expression blank muddied last year i wrote about the realities of work and childcare at the start of the pandemic and while much of our practical life has changed inside our bodies much is the same the biggest difference is that now nobody asks how were doing what this time has clarified for me quite meanly are the differences between parenting and having children the former being an activity and a skill one im yet to quite master the latter a fact a state of being which is layered with so many contrasting shades of love its tempting to chip it away to find the original wallpaper beneath when i was fresh out of hospital with the new baby i reread rachel cusks a lifes work her raw account of early motherhood and then straight afterwards read her response to reviews that called her a bad mother i was struck again at how it is still taboo to say i have a child but i want to be more than a mother and i continue to be struck by how conservative black and white how lacking in empathy these conversations if ever allowed to continue must be when ive written greyly in the past about wanting time away from my family i inevitably brace for the many angry responses if a person chooses to have a child theyve made their bed and there they must lie in silence among the crisp wrappers and crayons since cusks book came out instagram has happened where the versions of her angry reviews believe it or not quite a few people enjoy motherhood but in order to do so it is important to grow up first are reflected in blessy hashtags my guy best pal proud mama parenting is captured in bright sunlight a photo from the mothers gaze and its framing makes it even harder to talk honestly cuskily about its small hells let alone the occasional moments of doubt or regret in june a yougov survey of parents revealed one in say they regret having children similar polls around the world suggested many millions feel the same which suggests that rather than seeing this as simply individuals unspeakable sickness we might recognise that there is a larger problem we might consider the benefits both of restructuring society to make things easier for families such as improving childcare and work policies and encouraging a cultural shift in our expectations of parenthood to allow those with children to feel less guilt on bad days and of course relieve the pressure to have children at all but among the shock that follows these sorts of revelations theres rarely the acknowledgment that many surveyed might change their mind remember this question was asked at the tail end of a year that saw job losses sickness isolation loneliness and school closures anxiety and melancholy as standard a wet and awkward grief covering everything like dew parents were not in a good place many in fact were in pretty terrible ones made sharply out of lego and sticks why do we choose to forget this thing about humans this fact that we change that our minds and moods adapt that what seemed fun at midday is actually awful at pm we evolve our tastes alter our politics our partners our guilts but we are adults and we deal with it and try not to hurt anyone else in the process theres an exhibition in bath this month where artists have collaborated with their children for a show called my kid couldve done that sculptor harriet bowman told the guardian shed planned to make a piece about sharing a studio with her young son and while she started with an idea of a work in clay she couldnt stop thinking about less artful moments theyd spent together like when she was too busy to play and put him in front of the telly so the back wall of the gallery is covered in screenprints of yakka dee and alphablocks and a text about his tantrums and her shame as i sat on the stairs school still shut i thought about what my wall would look like all those shades of love

when my daughter ella was little id often see various tech products on my facebook feed purporting to calm parents who were anxious about their babys sleep next to feeding theres likely no more anxietyprone part of the day than a childs bedtime the fear theyre not on a schedule or that once they get on one its the wrong one or that once theyre actually asleep they might never wake up i dismissed them out of hand we were sharing a room with ella and i was aware of her every snort and snuffle though in retrospect it seems obvious that we could have had her sleeping through the night a little earlier if wed only settled on a sleep training method whichever one you pick neatly slots you into a parental taxonomy are you an adherent of dr richard ferbers method popularized in the s which encourages you to let your child cry it out until youre popping xanax like popcorn perhaps youre a disciple of twelve hours sleep by twelve weeks old which guarantees as much so long as youre willing to track her food and occasionally forcefeed her like a foie gras goose or maybe you purchased a california king bed the day you found out you were pregnant and now all sleep together your breasts exposed to the night air so junior can sidle up and have a sip whenever hed like we opted for an amalgam of each and at around four months old ella successfully dropped the horrible am feed but by the time our second daughter charlotte was born in the landscape was a smidge different the sleep tracker market was booming and my techloving husband started sending me links to various products promising us peace and serenity there was harvey karps snoo the smart bassinet that kicks data back to your phone while it jiggles your baby to sleep sometimes so quickly it looks like shes about to launch from cape canaveral there was the owlet smart sock which tracks your childs heart rate as he sleeps and issues an alarm if something is awry there was the miku pro smart baby monitor which allows you to see in real time your babys breathing waveform should that be up your alley i clicked on one mostly because it seemed to have taken sleep monitoring to onion headlinelevel extremes the nanit is an awardwinning camera that uses night vision and machine learning to track your childs movements and then spits out a sleep score in the morning the number factors in how long it took the child to fall asleep how many times the parent came in and how deep the sleep was when i told a friend with five children about it she snorted as if i need data to know how well my children sleep she replied either i feel like hell in the morning or i feel like hell warmed over but fresh to the world of mantoman parenting and coming to dread a bedtime when i had to nurse one baby while the other threw scarfacelevel tantrums in her room i decided to do a solid for my family and got in touch with nanit hq putting a child to sleep is one of the first problems youre dealing with as a new parent the nanit helps you formalize a strategy assaf glazer nanits founder and former ceo tells me when we meet at the midtown wework where he used to house part of the company glazer bald cleanshaven formerly of the israel defense forces completed his phd at the technion in haifa specializing in machine learning and computer vision and later worked on solutions for missile defense systems when he became a parent he found himself working late at night checking in on his son udi and wondering something only a former israeli air force pilot would ever wonder can i apply process control to a baby he knew that if the answer turned out to be yes he had an audience on average parents lose days of sleep during the first year of a babys life the camera glazer developed uses smart sensors to transmit sound and motion notifications to your phone and by tracking sleep patterns over time specifically with your child but also by bundling the data of thousands of babies and millions of nights of sleep it offers sleep tips to groggy parents the company has since gone on to add other products including smart sheets which track a babys growth and pajamas and other sleepwear that help the camera better read your childs nighttime movements if youre the kind of parent who simply wants to see how long their child slept the previous night glazer tells me fine but if you prefer charts and graphs about nap habits over time that rival the metrical intricacies of a spaceship launch the nanit can give you that too for the right clientele it occurs to me marketing this product is the equivalent of shooting fish in a barrel your audience is sleepaddled and susceptible imagine a child glazer tells me who has just thrown his pacifier out of the crib for the th time and is wailing if you know that itll take him only two more minutes of crying to put himself back to bed but youll prolong that by minutes if you go in to fetch the pacifier wont you stay outside a little longer i dont have to imagine when ella was younger my husband and i would often find ourselves in the wee hours inching around her floor on our stomachs like worms hunting for various glowinthedark pacifiers shed thrown out of her crib as she stood pouting a mini overlord of a glowing kingdom in many ways glazers pitch is compelling but i keep stumbling on the companys messaging rest easy your crib is covered reads the websites homepage the implication is that parents will only be able to fall asleep themselves once they know that a hitech camera is monitoring their childs every move why sids or sudden infant death syndrome which causes unexplained death in seemingly healthy children less than a year old it kills about children in the us each year and though my pediatrician assures me that its risk plummets if you breastfeed put babies on their backs and dont smoke its still a panicinducing acronym glazer i figure must viscerally understand this way down in the websites fine print i find a disclaimer nanit is not a medical device nanit is a connected product designed and intended to continuously learn from the data it collects to help you understand your babys sleep patterns it is not intended to diagnose treat or cure any disease or other condition including but not limited to sudden infant death syndrome sids false positive or false negative readings about your babys breathing patterns are a potential risk of nanit nanit should not substitute for the care and oversight of an adult or consultation with medical professionals but its buried below testimonials product descriptions and links to the companys pinterest page literally the last possible thing you can read in the teensiest type the website displays they are very clever in how they advertise dr rachel moon tells me about baby sleep tech devices when i reach her at the university of virginia where she is the division head of general pediatrics she also serves on the aaps task force on sids and has been a practicing pediatrician for more than years they never say that this will prevent sids but they come pretty close a friends baby was born prematurely and spent the first few months of her life being intensely monitored in the nicu various sleep devices like these understandably calmed my friends anxiety after she took her daughter home from the hospital and suddenly found herself alone with a child who mere days before had a team of professionals checking up on her hourly but for the vast majority of babies this level of tracking is wildly unnecessary my pediatrician assures me a doctor wouldnt release a child from the hospital if he or she needed it on top of that moon tells me researchers have sent hospitalgrade monitors home with highrisk children and the studies show they did nothing to prevent sids why would these newfangled nonmedical versions they get right up to the line so they dont have to be regulated by the fda which i think is irresponsible moon continues the vast majority of parents believe the fda is regulating all these products we know thats not true it gives you this false sense of complacency oh since i have this device on it gives me permission to do what i know im not supposed to do so you know your baby should be on a hard firm mattress in a crib but you want to cuddle at night as long as the device is on the reasoning might go i can snuggle away they use one behavior to compensate for another behavior which is potentially magnified with technology says moon after my conversation with moon i slowly started to internalize that much of this data gathering serves more to bolster parental anxiety than to guarantee a desired outcome for the child but however much i wanted to ignore the influx of information sleep related or otherwise i found it exceedingly difficult to look away and i wanted to know why why couldnt i just put my phone away internalize all the research id done about the futility of monitoring weight gained hours slept inches grown i was somewhat reassured when i learned this impulse to ingest data and process it lives deep within our fish brains embedded there after generations and generations of evolution we are the only species that has this biological imperative built in to the degree we do daniel j levitin professor emeritus of psychology and neuroscience at mcgill university tells me as levitin explains when we left the cover of trees as primates and went out onto the savannah we became prey in order to survive our brain evolved to acquire and process information about the environment other primates and that lion over there behind the rock those of us with good informationgathering skills were the ones who didnt just sit there in the wide open twiddling our opposable thumbs and waiting for said lion to come over and turn us into a midmorning snack each new hit of information we got back then triggered a release of dopamine and the same is true today except that release comes after you take a hit of ecstasy or get an iphone notification the problem is that in the last five years alone weve created more information as a species than in all of human history before it years ago youd learn about where the new fruit tree was and that was the big event of the week levitin tells me as for processing this information overload theres evolutionary lag he continues and it takes about years for our brains to catch up in the modern era with so much information bombarding us our attentional filter essentially becomes clogged and stops working properly but even if i were able to process all the data i wonder to what end my doctor has assured me that tracking after a certain point and in most cases is medically unnecessary as to whatever part of me might hope to use this data to program my child to behave in a certain way to sleep at a certain time to gain a certain amount of weight well any more seasoned parent will easily tell me you can control a child as much as you can force her to poop on command so shouldnt i save my money and free up my attentional filter in the process charlotte started sleeping through the night on her own by four months no devices no cryitout she just did it i have no idea why perhaps its because id become a different kind of parent or shes just wired a certain way but i know for certain it had nothing to do with any newfangled hitech sleep tracker im pregnant with no now with the baby safely in my uterus im fully prepared to scrub his or her sleep life of technology but having done this twice before all i can say is lets see how smug i am when the baby actually arrives and im ready to hop into a smart bassinet myself if ive learned anything its that you can control very little when it comes to parenting including your

when melinda wenner moyer looked around in the autumn of she saw everywhere what she would describe as assholes in the us and the uk hate crime was and is rising across the world metoo allegations continued to come donald trump was in the white house and i just felt like there was so much bad behaviour everywhere says moyer i started thinking about my kids and worrying about who were they going to become and what were they learning from this behaviour if they were seeing it on tv or hearing about it from their friends moyer realised what i wanted more than anything else was for my kids to not grow up to be assholes moyer a science journalist and parenting columnist decided to go through the research and ended up writing a book with the pleasing title how to raise kids who arent assholes in the vast realm of parenting advice there was plenty on diet sleep and how to turn your child into a superhuman genius but not a great deal on how to create a kind compassionate person i think there are probably a couple of reasons for this she says some parents have a fear she believes that instilling kindness is going to be to their childs detriment theyre going to be walked all over theyre not going to be successful its going to hold them back in some way but when i looked at the research on this it clearly suggested the opposite that kindness is actually strongly associated with success there was one study where researchers followed boys in particular and found that the boys who were the most helpful and generous in kindergarten ended up earning the most money when they were and were the least likely to be in prison the other reason she thinks is that if parents believe themselves to be good people in other words not an asshole or arsehole depending on where you are from that will be enough to ensure our children will be too i think there is something to that she says much of her book is about modelling good behaviour but i was also surprised by the research that really challenged some of my parenting instincts for instance in her chapter on raising children who dont become racist aiming specifically at white parents moyer recalls explaining to her then fiveyearold daughter why a black lives matter protest in the wake of the murder of george floyd was on the front page of the newspaper before she had looked at the research she would have questioned going into so much detail about racism with her children there is the idea that white parents shouldnt talk about race the research shows its very common that white parents in particular espouse colourblind parenting where we think that if we dont talk about race with our kids then they wont see it they wont make a big deal out of it theyll be less likely to become racist but the research shows that this is not what happens first of all we know that from the age of three months babies can discern skin colour and they like to look at pictures of adults who share the same skin colour as their caregivers so we know that they can see it and that theyre making judgments based on it when children being naturally curious try to make sense of why the world looks the way it does they see very easily in our society that most people who have power and prestige and money are white if parents and teachers arent talking about how racism is fuelling this hierarchy then kids come to the simplest conclusion well maybe white people have more power and money because theyre better add an embarrassed parent shushing them every time they mention race and they start to think of race as something bad unless parents push back against any stereotypes their child may be developing a study cited by moyer found that children whose white parents engaged with them about race became less prejudiced than those whose parents ignored it another area moyer found counterintuitive was selfesteem parents wellmeaning attempts to boost selfesteem often had the effect of undermining it putting pressure on our kids to do well in school enrolling them in all the extracurriculars and wanting them to be the best of the best that undermines their selfesteem because then they think of our love for them as being contingent on what they do and how they perform she says generally speaking the feeling of being unconditionally loved is one of the most crucial things for healthy selfesteem being overprotective can also harm it i feel a lot of parents now are so protective of kids in terms of not wanting them to experience failure or make mistakes moyer says she didnt plan to write a parenting book the premise kind of felt obnoxious to me like who am i to tell other parents what to do i dont know what im doing half the time she says over a video call from her home in the hudson valley new york where she lives with her husband an editor of a science magazine and their two children who are and seven her childhood was spent largely in atlanta georgia where her mother was an interior designer and her father a management consultant she describes their parenting as being in the authoritative style there were boundaries and lastresort consequences but an environment of love and empathy as opposed to the authoritarian style which is characterised by strict rules discipline and coldness writing the book made her revisit her childhood she says she was pleasantly surprised by a lot of what her parents did in the early s there were a lot more authoritarian parents and i think mine got a good balance of giving me respect and letting me make choices but also having clear boundaries i think theres only one point in the book where i called them out for something which is how they used to compare my sister and me they used to say that my sister was the gregarious one and i was shy and that definitely stuck with me after a period working for a biotech company moyer became a science journalist and after her son was born brought her research skills to a parenting column for slate magazine it came about she says with a laugh because i had so many questions and i didnt have any answers i was like ill use science to get answers which worked sometimes for the book she worked backwards from the idea of what makes an asshole and what parents can do to nurture opposite traits and values fostering generosity and helpfulness can mitigate selfishness among her strategies she advises being explicit about what is expected and highlighting the impact of childrens actions on other people as well as chapters on antiracism antisexism and how to support selfesteem without creating a narcissist she covers nurturing an honest child creating harmonious sibling relationships and resilience i definitely wanted to include bullying how do we raise kids who arent bullies what do we know about what primes kids to become bullies she was alarmed by her research that suggested the toxic political atmosphere was having an impact there was a study around the time of the us presidential election that found that in school districts that were very protrump there was an increase in bullying rates in schools compared with schools that were more proclinton she points to work done by the southern poverty law center on hate crimes after the election which included teachers who reported that they were seeing more hateful behaviour kids who had actually been saying the exact things that trump had said like build a wall so thats a little bit more evidence that kids were hearing these things and then thinking this is ok to do while moyer acknowledges in the book that bullying can often be perpetrated by a child who has seen or experienced domestic violence indeed much behaviour that could be described as assholeish could be explained by horrendous home circumstances there is a huge number of parents who would be surprised to learn that their child is a bully one study moyer cites found that nearly onethird of fifth graders to yearolds admitted to bullying behaviours yet only of their parents were aware of it one theme of moyers book is the importance of being obvious and literal with children another is the value of talking about things such as gender race sex and pornography however awkward it may feel this also includes things that we or our children may not even have considered before with the research on bullying i was surprised to read that a lot of kids who bully just dont understand that what theyre doing is hurtful she says we need to have these conversations about the fact that sometimes we can intend one thing but it will have a different impact laurie kramer a psychologist who specialises in sibling relationships told moyer that many children didnt realise that their parents wanted them to get on with their siblings they needed to be told moyers book highlights an uncomfortable truth that we may have to confront our own assholeish tendencies selfishness unconscious biases internalised misogyny an inability or unwillingness to understand other peoples perspectives before we can expect the same from our children moyer has put much of her research into practice she says it has changed her family for the better she has more patience and tries to see things from her childrens perspectives they have become more generous and think more about working together and helping each other i do feel like my kids have gotten along better since ive tried some of the sibling strategies she says they certainly fight still but there are times when i will see them negotiating in a way that i never used to proactively trying to problemsolve i do feel as if theres less conflict in the house and im less frustrated and angry than i used to be as a parent i feel like were closer because of that reassuringly however she admits she didnt become a better parent overnight it took her she writes at least six months to start putting it into practice and she doesnt get it right all the time i certainly make mistakes or do things in ways where later im like that probably wasnt the most constructive way to handle it but if she shouts or snaps or handles a situation unfairly or irrationally she will apologise sometimes i ask them for advice like what do you think i could have done in that moment that would have been more constructive were always correcting our kids i think they really love it when we ask for help and they can give advice also were showing how to apologise and that everybody makes mistakes it normalises the fact that were never going to be perfect and thats ok how to raise

the number of honourbased abuse hba offences recorded by english police forces has soared over the past five years figures suggest according to data from the out of constabularies that responded to freedom of information foi requests the number of hba cases including offences such as rape death threats and assault rose from in to last year a rise of while some of the increase in hba offences could be down to more victims coming forward and improved identification of offences by police imran khodabocus a senior associate at the family law company who represents families in such cases said the rise was alarming he said its essential education around what honourbased abuse is and how it impacts families is improved across the country these figures are likely to just show the tip of the iceberg lockdowns have exacerbated the problem for many and as we continue to get back to normal life i expect to see even more cases involving honourbased abuse of course due to the very nature of these cases its likely many victims will never even think to approach the police and the issues are often not recognised by schools social services or the police forced marriage and female genital mutilation fgm are other instances of hba offences committed according to the crown prosecution service to protect or defend the honour of an individual family andor community for alleged or perceived breaches of the family andor communitys code of behaviour there are estimated to be to socalled honour killings in britain every year notorious cases include banaz mahmod whose father uncle and other relatives plotted to murder her after she left an allegedly abusive marriage and fell in love with another man and samia shahid from bradford who was killed on a trip to pakistan shahids exhusband and father were arrested in pakistan in connection with her death but her father died while on bail and nobody has stood trial the home office has collected data from police forces on hba offences on a mandatory basis since april its first figures described as experimental showed offences recorded in although it said as it was often a hidden crime this was likely to have been a small proportion of offences actually committed greater manchester police gmp were excluded from the home office figures because they could not supply data owing to installation of a new it system and were unable to respond to the foi request either karma nirvana a charity that supports victims of honourbased violence said the omission of figures from gmp englands third biggest force was significant as the area generates a lot of calls to its helpline natasha rattu the director of karma nirvana acknowledged police identification of such crimes was better albeit still with room for improvement but said the fact that there are increases suggests that people are and have been feeling more desperate or more at risk the charity wants a fresh review of policing of honourbased abuse by hm inspectorate of constabulary as it says many of the recommendations of the last report in which found police were not doing enough to protect victims have not been implemented a national police chiefs council spokesperson said we acknowledge that these abuses are hugely underreported and we remain focused on giving victims the confidence and come forward i urge anyone with information or concerns about

labours stella creasy is launching a project to fund mothers who want to get involved in politics after describing her heartbreak at the way the party has responded to her calls for proper maternity cover for mps creasy who gave birth to her second child four weeks ago said many in the labour movement were frustrated at the way women of childbearing age are treated in politics she is launching a campaign called votemama uk to help support parents in politics modelled on the votemama movement in the us the mp for walthamstow in london has been engaged in a battle with the independent parliamentary standards authority to get a locum paid near to her own salary rate to cover her constituency casework the law prevents a locum from being able to cover the parliamentary work of mps on parental leave creasy said she did not feel sufficiently supported by labour including other women in her party in her campaign for maternity rights for mps which she believes would encourage more women of childbearing age to enter politics i have been heartbroken by the way in which my party has responded to calls for maternity cover for mps and sadly from talking to many in our movement i am not alone in feeling frustrated she said its not rocket science why so few women of childbearing age go into politics or stay in it that isnt going to change unless we act to tackle the deterrents to running that start before you even stand for office as well as those which persist long after she said labour needed to admit it has a blindspot when it comes to mums and called on it to be the first political party here in the uk to learn from the approach taken by our american counterparts and the success of votemama in breaking down barriers for parents to politics the votemama uk campaign aims to help fund and mentor new parents who want to get into politics the american version of the campaign has endorsed funded and mentored nearly mums running at levels ranging from school board to senate it provides direct contributions to the campaigns of supported candidates and has campaigned to pass legislation at the state level to expand a federal election commission ruling that all state and local candidates should be able to use their campaign funds for childcare creasy said it was not illegal in the uk to use campaign funds to fund childcare but she was not aware of anyone who had done this she said if there was enough interest in votemama uk then the group would directly fund candidates helping them to cover the cost of childcare she said it would also support changing the way selections are run to make it easier for parents to participate in an interview with the guardians saturday magazine creasy spoke about her frustration with her battle for maternity cover i know that some have suggested that this is golden skirt feminism an elite asking for special privileges but actually for me its about the message that we send that our politics should be open to everybody at

daddy asks my son in that same voice i know from roughly of our interactions do you like going on big red buses he asks me this a few times a day even while we are literally on big red buses deploying it as a sort of conversational chaff grenade entirely for subjectchanging purposes much the way you or i might say sooooooo how are things when faced with a person whose name you cant remember at a party oh yes i reply very much his fascination with london buses is quite charming but it is odd that he is asking this on an aeroplane its our first boysonly trip and im quite excited more so than my son who doesnt appear to have any fascination with planes compared to the flashier but altogether more earthbound vehicles of the london transport network my son is three and has now flown a dozen times whereas i dont think i got on a plane until i was at least so the whole experience still thrills me a little the fact it doesnt thrill me more or my son at all is weird human flight long imagined as a mythic fantasy from daedalus to da vinci now so commonplace that it is anticipated as a chore and largely undertaken drowsy hungover or in my sons case asking about municipal vehicles back in his day my dad says people used to wear their best clothes on flights although whether this was due to a sense of occasion im not sure it could just be that they wanted their corpses welldressed in the event that they went down in flames since i presume planes back then were all made of wood and filled with people chainsmoking for the entire hours it took to cross the irish sea a lot of my excitement for this trip is of course terror my son can be a handful and travelling from london to derry with him alone by car train plane bus and then car again is not for the weak of heart perhaps if he was in a state of euphoria over the miracle of flight things would be worse luckily for me men travelling on planes with very cute children get a lot of slack certainly more than i remember my wife reporting when she made a similar trip earlier in the year im not saying the bar for men is low but at several points on our journey i am given fawning looks by fellow passengers just for wiping his nose handing him a snack or telling him that i reckon planes used to catch fire all the time this is presumably because they cant believe im not spending the flight doing something more stereotypically male like brewing my own beer or recording a podcast about the second world war but i am only too happy to receive their adulation because i am tired and vain and will take any kindness on offer on several occasions he is asked where his mummy is enough times in fact that i cant rule out the chance they fear hes been kidnapped he always replies the same way er yes they

stella creasy is dodging people on the pavement as we talk she apologises for the background noise but its hard finding time for a conversation when you have a newborn son a toddler daughter and no proper maternity leave from a fulltime job as labour mp for walthamstow this walk to an appointment is the only window she has last month she spoke in a commons debate on childcare baby pip in a sling sounding astonishingly composed for someone who had given birth four weeks earlier i ask how shes feeling and she laughs briefly and says tired as hell mad as anything and then it all comes tumbling out the night before that debate shed been in hospital with an infection she thinks was brought on by doing too much the day after her caesarean she was dialling into meetings with the defence secretary from hospital she has had about cases in her london constituency of people seeking help getting family members out of afghanistan and has barely stopped since there wasnt any alternative she says these are people ringing up my staff threatening to kill themselves because theyre so worried about family members you can hear the terror in their voices meanwhile shes grappling with the mum guilt for not taking more time off while struggling to be patient with people in parliament who ask how she is only to back away when answered honestly having lost a battle with the independent parliamentary standards authority ipsa this summer over the maternity leave cover she wanted creasy refuses to draw a polite veil over the consequences and if that means breaking the working mother taboo against admitting that everything is not in fact fine then so be it what we ask mothers to do is disappear and not make anyone feel awkward or uncomfortable she says people who have made promises that they would investigate this matter are coming back to me saying oh great youve had the baby and its ok now wellmeaning colleagues tell her she says to look after herself but it would be really great if i had someone to look after the other stuff rather than telling me ive been doing too much and that in a nutshell is her issue since theyre not legally classified as employees mps arent entitled to statutory maternity leave new mothers get time off westminster duties but what happens in parliament is only a small part of the workload there is no official leave from dealing with constituents problems an unsung but vital part of the job so mps have traditionally fudged their way through postchildbirth trying to take some time off without letting voters down but creasy who suffered a series of miscarriages before getting pregnant with her daughter hettie in wanted clearer boundaries for that pregnancy she fought to hire parliaments first ever locum to cover the constituency for six months kizzy gardiner an excharity worker and local labour party member stood in for creasy everywhere but the commons chamber which as an unelected person she couldnt lawfully enter the arrangement worked well but creasy felt guilty that her standin wasnt paid anywhere near an mps rate so after she got pregnant again last autumn she applied for another locum on closer to her salary ipsa refused to authorise more than arguing that an unelected standin couldnt legally cover duties such as questioning ministers in the chamber ipsa declined to comment for this article but cited a previous statement arguing it is up to parliament to decide if the law should be changed so an unelected person can undertake these duties when an mp cant be there relations soured sufficiently that creasy engaged lawyers as her due date approached she applied for extra caseworkers to cover at least some of the workload but says that was also rejected on cost grounds so she has barely stopped working at all turning up to debates now seems partly about signalling that she wont go quietly even if it means making people feel uncomfortable looking my kid in the eye even that elicited a tickingoff from parliamentary clerks who argued that she hadnt given the required days notice for coming in while on voting leave she says she is tired of being treated as if she was being difficult for wanting to try something that is routine in other workplaces but novel to parliament im not difficult just different creasy says i know there are a lot of other mps going through this now and i know there will be more if so perhaps the most painful aspect has been the gap opening between creasy and some of her own female colleagues at least one of whom said something that many months later she will tell me she still cant forgive stella creasy is not afraid of ruffling feathers born into an avidly laboursupporting middleclass family she grew up in colchester in essex the daughter of a teacher her mother and an opera singer her father after reading social and political sciences at cambridge she cut her teeth in politics as a researcher to labour mps including douglas alexander and charles clarke then as a councillor in the london borough of waltham forest she was selected from an allwoman shortlist to fight the safe seat of walthamstow and stood out from the moment she was elected in thanks to a series of highprofile campaigns on mediafriendly issues she fought successfully to cap the cost of socalled payday loans with some lenders charging desperate people interest rates of up to and for a crackdown on misogynistic internet trolling more recently she has campaigned to make misogyny a hate crime within months of being elected she was on ed milibands frontbench as shadow minister for crime prevention and four years after that she came runnerup to tom watson in labours deputy leadership contest a mark of her grassroots popularity gregarious as she is there is something of the cat that walks alone about creasy during her frontbench years there were mutterings about her not being a team player its a criticism rarely aimed at similarly independentminded men of course but its true that she seems happier launching onewoman crusades than reciting someone elses lines while she rarely rebels against the whip she likes to plough her own furrow when choosing causes when i ask if her battle for maternity cover was complicated by factional rivalry inside labour shes seen as being on the right she says plaintively no because im clearly not in anybodys gang am i out in the cold politically during the corbyn years she is ideologically closer to keir starmer yet remains on the backbenches at only she jokes that shes practically a grandee a westminster nickname for former big beasts periodically weighing in from a distance her courage however is not in doubt she has faced death threats from the far right over her antimisogyny campaigns deselection threats from the left over her criticisms of corbyn and after campaigning for abortion rights for northern irish women antiabortion campaigners plastering her constituency with posters featuring dead foetuses creasy normally brushes such things off but the brutal murder of the conservative mp david amess a few weeks after our interview forces many mps to think twice about the risks they run in politics when i call creasy again shortly after amesss death she is clearly upset i cant comprehend that im not going to see him again standing at the top of the escalators asking me about the kids she says as the baby gurgles on her lap but she is nonetheless frustrated by arguments that mps may need to become less open to their constituents if there are people out there targeting public figures then we should be targeting those people not asking public figures to be in a gilded cage she says my worry is that we have become almost inured to the idea that this is going to happen and that the debate is about what security mps have not how are we riskassessing the threats people might face its this idea that the system needs to change rather than individuals simply being expected to tough it out that also colours creasys approach to how parliament handles working parents things have changed since when a heavily pregnant and newly elected harriet harman arrived in parliament to letters from the public saying her children would suffer from having a working mother parliamentary working hours were reformed to reduce latenight votes and the commons now has its own nursery in labours yvette cooper became the first minister to take maternity leave in office in proxy votes were introduced for pregnant or sick mps after labours tulip siddiq was forced to vote from a wheelchair the day before her caesarean other european countries including denmark and holland have introduced full maternity cover for parliamentarians but in the british system constituency work remains a hurdle given the personal nature of mps connection with the people they represent an expectation lingers that politicians cant be seen to need time off mirroring the fear many working mothers have of being perceived as uncommitted creasy however wonders why more women dont talk honestly about all this its almost like this instagram thing isnt it weve all got this were all amazing wonderful people therefore carry on and you think ok but maybe we could also make it a bit easier besides she says she doesnt want to lie to constituents they live in a world where if this happened in their own workplaces they would have rights if people want to start saying this is why we shouldnt have mps who are women of childbearing age then its a very troubling development shell hate the comparison but i am reminded of the then tory mp louise mensch announcing a decade ago in the middle of a televised parliamentary hearing that she was leaving early to collect her kids mensch a highprofile figure who had been a bestselling author before politics divided opinion between those who thought it a powerful statement that everyone has childcare needs and those who thought she was letting the side down or grandstanding having discussed it privately with mensch afterwards i found she very much had her reasons and something similar is true of creasy when we first speak at length in august she is still eight months pregnant with pip and suffering from gestational diabetes a condition with which pregnant womens bodies become temporarily unable to regulate their blood sugars outwardly polished in bright pink lipstick she is clearly anxious on the inside a few days earlier she went to aampe scared because she couldnt feel the baby moving stillbirth is a risk with the condition despite taking a cocktail of drugs to manage it she has been warned correctly as it turns out that shell probably have to deliver the baby prematurely she tells me im terrified because it is my body doing something that puts my baby at risk the longer a baby stays in the womb the better it is for it but if your womb is suddenly a toxic place she trails off before adding my partner talks about my selfloathing hes like youre blaming yourself because you do ive lost babies before so its the worst that can happen in the sense of your fear and your desperate desire as a mother to protect your child had she been her own employer shed have signed herself off but that isnt an option when over the summer walthamstow suffers flash flooding three murders and the fallout of events in kabul creasy fought the general election while eight and a half months pregnant with hettie but this she says is tougher its a very sudden thing you feel extremely hot and tired and confused you dont get any warning with gestational diabetes during her first pregnancy she was sending emails on the way over to the hospital this time she knows she isnt well and of course thats a worry what that does to the baby as well because stress is connected to your sugars she keeps underlining that her situation isnt unique one in four women have experienced pregnancy discrimination during the pandemic while many working mothers fear being singled out for redundancy as furlough ends a lot of the work ive done over the last year with campaigning organisations like pregnant then screwed has been about getting into the conversations happening at national level why do we think motherhood should be about sacrifice in some way that every mother should be a martyr i dont want to be a martyr i just want to be a good mum and a good mp having a locum with hettie had she says helped that feel possible but then creasy says something unexpected often the employers and the people who can be hardest on pregnant women are other women and that will chime with other people the sadness of the sisterly solidarity that you might think is there falling short what does she mean she hesitates briefly then says i had one of my colleagues suggest to me in that i was using the fact that id had multiple miscarriages and the lack of maternity cover to get myself coverage i have to say i held it together in that meeting and walked out and burst into tears because if anybody thinks its easy to talk about experiencing miscarriage and then subsequent pregnancies she wont say who it was except that it was a woman when campaigning for her first locum in creasy wrote to all the party leaders and was grateful for the support of theresa may the then liberal democrat leader jo swinson and the snps ian blackford there was she says no response from jeremy corbyns office starmer sent flowers when her second baby was born but when she wrote back detailing concerns about maternity cover she says his office did not follow up she was she adds warned off campaigning for a locum by other mothers in parliament i know that some have suggested that this is golden skirt feminism an elite asking for special privileges but actually for me its about the message that we send that our politics should be open to everybody at all stages of their lives from whatever background still she was genuinely shocked when ipsa disclosed that its decision in not to consult on introducing locums for maternity cover was influenced by opposition from the womens parliamentary labour party then chaired by the feminist mp jess phillips im not going to pretend its not heartbreaking for me as somebody who has been active as a feminist and a socialist all my life that there is an opposition within my own party creasy says the puzzle is why other female mps with lifelong records of fighting for other womens rights seem so reluctant to demand their own asking around female labour mps the consensus is that its partly bad timing during the hung parliament under theresa may when every vote counted and pregnant mps were under intense pressure there was crossparty support for compassionate reforms now that the tories have a big majority absences are much easier to arrange but the biggest hurdle is that mps are still paid in full while on leave from voting many are wary of arguing publicly for what would be maternity leave on full pay at a time when many ordinary womens packages are not so generous and politicians are already unpopular during a meeting of female mps in to decide a common position on locums which creasy couldnt attend many voiced concerns about getting a better deal than their constituents phillips tells me it just was not the prevailing wind of the room who were mostly either pregnant or had recently returned from maternity leave and felt nervous rightly or wrongly about asking for too much she says although she points out that views may change over time stella has our support in whats clearly been a very difficult time for her if any woman feels the system is working against her having a baby weve got to try to make it better creasy for her part says shes acutely aware of concerns about seeking a better deal than women in other workplaces but points out that in february the government amended legislation to allow the pregnant attorney general suella braverman to take maternity leave on full pay from her cabinet job why shouldnt there be she argues the same deal for backbenchers as tory ministers still to date no other mp has tried to get a locum months of banging her head against this brick wall have clearly taken their toll following a difficult pregnancy and repeated miscarriages earlier this month creasy marked baby loss awareness week on facebook by posting some old pictures of herself at work in a meeting being filmed at a protest noting that in each one she was secretly in the middle of losing a baby when i ask if shes ever tempted to quit politics altogether she insists shes going nowhere im sorry to disappoint the many who will be hopeful she says wryly ive been in the labour movement since i was a yearold and ive campaigned and disagreed with every single labour party leader my entire life and im sure that will continue im a woman who knows her own mind besides she says the pushback has encouraged her to keep campaigning on issues such as the cost of childcare and workplace discrimination in pregnancy there must she argues be thousands of women whose talents are being wasted because theyre made to feel unwelcome at work after having children would she still encourage women to enter politics though that is she snorts half the point of having the argument there are already people online doing that if you wanted to have babies you should never have stood thing and every time i read those i remember why im fighting because there are brilliant women out there who should be able to have kids and do politics i dont want to ask brilliant women to wait years until their kids have grown up its all very well saying that others have managed or muddled through in the past she says but the socialist case is not to ask women to manage its a radical change of scenery which means that we unlock the potential of everybody we cant be in a position where we think its acceptable that most women in public life are either of a certain age or have made the choice not to have children any future change in the rules will come too late for creasy who isnt planning to have another child but that wont she suggests stop her battling on you could say i clearly havent won my colleagues over on this and i need to do more work she says but do i think that this is how our politics should be that we let a few more women in so long as they will play by the rules of the existing status quo no as long as i am an mp i will keep pushing the boat even it seems if that comes at some personal cost,2021-10,stella creasy dodging

take a moment to say goodbye to your old life this is what kit harington said earlier this year when asked what advice hed give to fellow new parents the actor best known as the angstridden bastard prince jon snow in the fantasy series game of thrones regretted not having held a proper celebration before the birth of his son in january harington said he would have liked to mark the occasion with a kind of stag youre so prepped about gearing up for being a parent that you forget and then its too late its gone yet its the kind of sob story thats likely to invite eyerolls from mothers for whom this approach to having a baby is not a matter of negotiation but while few new fathers will admit it in public many will recognise the sentiment during the latter months of my wifes pregnancy i found myself staying out longer than i meant to as if my subconscious was warning me that pub hours might be limited in the near future its probably for the best that my subconscious didnt know anything about viruses you can see why some men and their partners are concluding it might be safer to formalise the arrangement anecdotally at least harington is not alone prebaby celebrations are on the rise with heterosexual marriages at their lowest level since prewedding stags dos are less of a thing for men wanting to mark a new phase in their life the birth of a first child is the obvious moment theres been a steady increase in the number of inquiries for baby stags otherwise known as dadchelor parties over the past few years says rob hill chief executive of bookings site fizzbox compared with stags hill adds these dad dos tend to be cheaper shorter and more local with taking place in the uk the dadstobe may not be paintballing in prague or bungeejumping in budapest but you could find them quad biking in liverpool or playing bubble football in manchester many fatherstobe feel the events they have in mind bear little relation to the traditional stag nomenclature is also an issue dad do seems preferable to baby stag which is superior to dadchelor party but none feels quite right the link with oldfashioned stags and their connotations of laborious organised fun with near strangers doesnt do justice to the breadth of motivation behind these novel celebrations three years ago with his babys due date approaching architect eddie blake and a few close friends cycled out to essex from london to drink and mark the impending arrival my girlfriend laura and i arent married so i havent had a stag do i wanted some recognition of the shift in my circumstances as i became a father he says we got drunk but it wasnt a bratislavatype strippers thing it was emotional having old friends being there for you and acknowledging that its a big thing thats about to happen to you but its going to be fun one of the friends had already had a kid so he passed down some wisdom he also gave me a little tie to attach the dummy to the babys suit so you dont endlessly lose dummies we talked about being kind and generous with your partner and avoiding the vicious am sleepdeprived arguments the beast from the east was blowing which lent things a certain portentousness cycling is good for talking it was helpful blake says that the event didnt come with the baggage of a stag do im awkward around stags especially if theres destructive behaviour but this felt like a new idea theres a lot of ritualised attention around the mother at the time of the birth so trying to invent a ritual around the new father role felt like a sensible thing to do roi perez a social media account director and his wife sophie are expecting their first child in early december hes planning to have a night out with friends before the birth but rejects the idea he is mourning his party era ive had comments from people telling me my days are numbered he says but i think of it more as a next step during the pregnancy perez says he has been struck by how little sharing goes on between men about whats about to happen women get together to share baby information nothing like that would ever happen with guys women are much better at communicating with each other so theyre really good at transferring that knowledge ive been making a conscious effort to get involved because if you dont you can feel peripheral hopefully this event will be part of that i dont want it to be too laddy because thats not the point for blake the event was also a recognition that he planned to take his paternal duties seriously there are a lot of questions around masculinity when you are deciding to be a more involved dad because you are taking on more of the mothering role its uncharted territory laura supported his paternitour it was only a month before the birth so there was a bit of jeopardy he says she told me not to go much further than we did in the end the baby came a week early she said thank god youre not in essex because id have been really angry not everyone will agree that british culture is in need of another ritual in which men go off to get drunk with their mates and while blake and perez want to create meaningful markers some fatherstobe do crave a traditional bender im terrified it might be my last chance of behaving like kevin and perry without knowing ive got a kid at home that im letting down says ben an accountant he is expecting his first child later this year but planning a week in ibiza with a mate first my girlfriends not happy but ive made it a redline issue ive said ill pay for her to go anywhere she wants with a friend next year shes threatening that if i insist on doing this her price might be that we have to get married i admit that has given me second thoughts but weve paid our deposit at the beach club now others are more conflicted i worked hard to justify my baby stag to myself says james a lecturer in newcastle who went for a weekend in berlin before the birth of his son i felt guilty that i could do something my partner wasnt able to do in the same way she took the mick and found it funny that i felt the need to go away and cut loose i tried to balance being as conscientious as possible with the approachingmiddleage anxiety that this would be the end of my life he says that he is conscious of being more present than his own father was without getting too psychoanalytic my dad was useless he says he didnt change his life at all when we were born whenever i do something that feels like its male behaviour of a previous generation like getting wrecked in berlin i worry that im just going to end up a crappy dad like many modern celebrations the dad do started in the us the baby shower another american import is also increasing in popularity but they tend to be about anointment rather than escape they look forward to the new chapter often with cupcakes rather than back at vanished hedonism the existence of the dad do implies a recognition that having a baby will mean a lifestyle change for the father as well as for the mother the rise of baby stags reflects a generational shift in fathering practices says dr jeremy davies from think and do tank the fatherhood institute for my fathers generation there might have been a cigar after the birth but beyond that it was business as usual it wasnt your role to do the handson stuff covid has accelerated the shift in domestic duties a fatherhood institute report found that since the pandemic of fathers were spending more time with their children and were doing more of the housework but while the attitudes of new parents may be evolving the social structures havent caught up young people imagine that they are going to share the earning and caregiving responsibilities as equally as possible says davies but then when the child arrives they realise that society is still set up to support women to do all the caring and push the men off to work although shared parental leave is on the rise britain lags behind many of its european peers in attitudes to child rearing theres very little done by statutory services to help dads so young men are finding their own way through this but theyre feeling their way in the dark increasing numbers of baby stags at least shows that men now recognise this and are trying to rectify it starting with a big night out some names have been changed,2021-10,take moment say goodbye old life kit harington said earlier year asked advice hed give

for the first time in nearly two years we hosted my wifes parents sean and marian this week im lucky that i love my inlaws or perhaps theyre lucky that i have to say as much since they read this column and id get into trouble otherwise but its true that hosting them is a treat not least because a they adore my son b he adores them and c they are such fastidiously good guests it puts the rest of humanity to shame when i stay in someones house i try not to be messy or demanding but do also find myself relaxing into that teenage state of cloistered indolence i call guest mode you know the thing you tidy up and cook a few meals but are broadly content to be waited on like a lowlevel vip if im guilty of sometimes treating their house like a hotel it could be said they do the same for ours but in the sense that they themselves insist on being staff minutes after arriving sean was eyeing up the missing lightbulbs in the living room and had procured replacements within hours several of my sons toy trains and fire engines long devoid of power due to his noiseaverse parents had their batteries replaced a day after that marian meanwhile was soon attacking every surface in our home with the energy of those people who clean up after crime scenes and ironed every item of clothing we own until each shirt trouser and sock could comfortably slide under a firmly locked door it was lovely to see them once more fitting into the space of our small flat only to gradually make it larger by decluttering as they went the biggest scale differential is of course the boy himself who has grown half a foot since july he has not yet realised his own size and took to clattering himself gamely into his nana and grandad until a pleasantly bruising cacophony of ooofs and aahhs resounded throughout our newly sparkling flat perhaps similarly enamoured of them as guests he took on the mantle of host with a trip to see the big red buses and sparkling lights of central london he even took them to the transport museum where he got to look at trains talk about trains and drive a train while looking at and talking about trains while there they werent able to make use of any of the older machines since they cant be exposed to the industrial strength chemicals necessary to keep them up to covid code even i a relative agnostic in the field of mass transport vehicles feel a faint pluck at the eyelid imagining those doughty old engines lying in the dark as if they too had had their batteries removed unaccosted by the grubby mitts of trainmad toddlers they sat as a silent ropedoff reminder of the petty deficits the pandemic has still not found a way to pay off maybe they needed the rest anyway or perhaps like nana and grandad theyd figure a clatter or two was worth the wait did

we call it her incharge day a day when our nineyearold daughter flora is in charge and we are effectively hers to command a day when all the traditional hierarchies between parent and child are reversed when she can fulfil her fantasies refuse to do anything she doesnt want to and experience a taste of power authority and absolute freedom ok not absolute freedom there are some ground rules she cant do anything we deem to be unsafe or illegal she cant ask us to buy anything too expensive we keep this part deliberately vague and this year we realised we needed to add one more sentence of small print to our contract she cannot purchase any new pets every year we give her a gift voucher for this day on her birthday in january we set the time and the date ourselves hours in charge from pm on a saturday until pm on sunday usually at the end of spring it is something i know she greatly looks forward to through the winter and it is a reminder to us that her childhood is passing that one day she will be an adult in charge of her own life able to do as she pleases every day that each day we spend with her when she is still our little girl is precious there is a song in matilda the musical where the characters sing about how when they grow up they will have treats everyday and watch cartoons all the time and go to bed late every night the irony of course is that when they do grow up they will probably no longer be quite so keen to do those things this idea that childhood wishes are destined to fade away unfulfilled has always seemed a little sad to me i may however be alone in taking songs from hit musicals so seriously certainly when i tell other parents that my husband neil and i give our daughter this incharge day as a gift each year they find it not only bizarre but terrifying handing over all control over your lives to your child for hours are you mad is a typical response there were definitely moments the first time we decided to do it three years ago when i asked myself the same question but i was curious my parenting style is very different to that of my own parents they had me late in life and i was a muchlonged for child they found great joy in indulging my every whim i assumed i would want to treat my own children the same way but to my great surprise i didnt even though my love for flora was greater than anything i could have imagined i still wanted some space from her occasionally i wanted free time every evening a reasonably tidy house and if at all possible a decent nights sleep in my own bed and i soon came to realise that if i wanted all that my husband and i would need to set boundaries and learn how to say no to our child which we duly did much to the bemusement of her besotted grandparents but i did wonder was flora missing out on some of the fun id had growing up in a more permissive household and maybe some of the valuable lessons id learned about making my own choices too we had been reading danny the champion of the world together and i found myself thinking about roald dahls epilogue at the end which i remembered passionately agreeing with as a child a message to children who have read this book when you growup and have children of your own do please remember something important a stodgy parent is no fun at all what a child wants and deserves is a parent who is sparky was i sparky enough i wondered a little voice in my head said no i had read about other parents doing similar experiments with their children and it all going horribly wrong but i told myself optimistically that because flora was an only child it would be pretty straightforward to follow her rules she alone would be in charge with no bickering siblings to contend with or any other children with competing demands for us to have to manage and it was only for one day how hard would it really be to let her do anything she wanted to for just hours ill never forget how ecstatic she was when we told her she was six and immediately started planning making a list of all the normally forbidden things that she would get to do and eat and fantasising about how much fun it would be seemed to be a real source of pleasure in itself and once when i refused to let her do something she replied thats fine mummy i will do it on my incharge day instead i was taken aback but then i realised what she was really saying that knowing she would have hours of living by her own rules was helping her to live by our rules the rest of the time as the big day loomed closer i found myself getting tense would i be able to say yes to everything would it all end in tears the first thing she wanted to do was have lunch at mcdonalds as i sat there tucking into french fries and nervously awaiting her next command a sentence from where the wild things are came to mind and now cried max let the wild rumpus start twentyfour hours later we were exhausted but amazed without realising we were going to we had enjoyed every second every nerveracking exhilarating crazy second and every year since has been the same as we expected flora likes to stay up late eat lots of junk food and watch lots of screens but she also derives a lot of pleasure from simple innocent pastimes like choosing sweets in a sweetshop or having a picnic or cuddling up in bed at night with our puppy not usually allowed she likes dressing up in voluminous dresses and going out to the cinema where she can have popcorn and icecream and sweets she likes curling up in bed with a good book and a slice of chocolate cake its not difficult to let her follow her own rules for hours in other words its delightful i was particularly touched to discover that she has a strong desire to relive specific happy memories of times wed had together a bike ride in the local park a game we played pancakes for breakfast moments of collective joy that i hadnt realised at the time meant so much to her the other thing she loves doing is parenting us that first year she gave me a bath and washed my hair then she brushed our teeth read us stories and put us to bed at pm while she stayed up watching endless octonauts and eating an entire box of coco pops we didnt plan to fall asleep but the feeling of being nurtured so sweetly by a sixyearold was overwhelming i woke up at pm and dashed downstairs to discover her sitting happily on the sofa surrounded by chocolate biscuits marshmallows and the aforementioned box of coco pops she confessed she was feeling a bit sick she did manage to achieve her objective of staying up past midnight cuddled up next to me but never again expressed any desire to watch octonauts or eat coco pops for that matter but mostly the person who learned lessons is me like the other parents who tried this experiment for a clearly defined period of time i find it liberating to say yes to my child all the time both my husband and i feel so carefree so unburdened by the need to persuade her to do anything she doesnt want to do or take her places she doesnt want to go we realised that by putting her in charge we were actually giving ourselves a day off dont get me wrong i am not planning to put her in charge all the time it would be bad for her diet clearly but the experience has taught me to live more in the moment and say yes to her more often on other days too i learned something i had somehow managed to forget that children really do know how to have fun and that if as a parent you are brave enough to put your child in charge even for just hours one thing is for sure your life is about to get a whole lot more sparky let the wild rumpus begin dos and donts do give your child time to plan the day set ground rules nothing illegal or unsafe or too expensive put one child in charge at a time send

here we go again every time a woman is a victim of male violence there is a major public discussion on how they can protect themselves last week a british police commissioner said that sarah everard an english woman killed in march by a police officer never should have submitted to the false arrest that led to her rape and murder women first of all need to be streetwise about when they can be arrested and when they cant be arrested the commissioner said everards killer wayne couzens had falsely arrested her for supposedly violating londons covid regulations this week florida police found the body of a missing woman miya marcano marcano was being harassed by armando manuel caballero a maintenance worker in her building whose advances she had turned down several times before she went missing police are pretty sure that caballero who killed himself before he could be arrested was responsible for marcanos death as news of marcanos disappearance and death spread my social media timelines were flooded with posts about how other women can prevent a similar fate from befalling them while i can understand womens instinct to figure out how to protect ourselves in a society that clearly wont this endless focus on womens actions is tantamount to victimblaming and perpetuates the bizarre idea that women can somehow have agency over the actions of violent men its also a completely useless way of trying to address genderbased violence statistics show that one out of every six american women has been a victim of an attempted or completed rape in her lifetime and poor trans and racialized women are disproportionately affected by this almost of american indian and alaska native women have experienced some form of sexual violence stalking or aggression by an intimate partner in their lifetime in black women were two and a half times more likely to be murdered by men than white women no amount of senseless fingerwagging is going to stop harmful men from taking advantage of their positions feeling entitled to womens bodies and enacting the kind of violence that they know society will ultimately blame women for this fingerwagging also does little to address the root cause of this issue male violence its a frustrating but predictable cycle frustrating because any woman will tell you there are very few ways to stop a man from attacking you without consequence if he really sets his mind to it and predictable because we live in a world that will do anything to absolve men of responsibility society infantilizes men treating them from an early age like mere victims of their uncontrollable urges while constantly telling women to smarten up so we dont fall victim to said urges in reality focusing on preventative interventions for men and boys is the only way to stop male violence the criminal justice system fails women so often that the justice system is simply not a good deterrent and many women are understandably hesitant to report the fact that they have been victimized by men frankly by the time the police show up to arrest a bad man the damage has usually already been done another infuriating element to this are the ways that the media and society tend to frame stories like marcanos numerous publications referred to caballero as spurned and called his harassment of miya romantic overtures there is nothing romantic about being stalked by someone who has a key to your apartment and no regard for your boundaries women have said this over and over again but somehow society is more comfortable empathizing with a man trying to get the girl than naming something for what it is stalking and harassment i dont want to learn a new trick for how to protect my drink in a club or how to use a pocket knife hidden in my lipstick or have to buy some strange contraption to make sure my hotel room door stays locked i want to live in a world where women dont have to live in constant fear for their own safety and where i can turn

compel action dame vera baird victims commissioner if we are to truly turn the tide of male violence against women and girls we need to see the government compel the police to act this starts with the government promoting tackling violence against women and girls to the status of a national strategic policing requirement this would compel every force in the country to treat it with the same urgency and priority as terrorism and county lines it would afford it more resources coordination from the highest levels and true leadership but change must start with the police we know from recent investigations that over allegations of domestic abuse have been made against police officers and staff over the past five years just cases were prosecuted demonstrating that police dont recognise the problem in their own ranks let alone treat it with the seriousness it requires this has to change urgently im afraid the burden now falls to the home secretary to force the polices hand listen to us evie hairsine founder of our bodies our streets a grassroots organisation in sheffield i think the police need to put listening first and be more transparent about the fact that things are going wrong they should open up to a womenled advisory coalition of groups working in this area and make themselves vulnerable to being told what they need to do the biggest problem is within the police force itself i think there should be immediate removal and suspension of any officer whos suspected of committing an offence before they do anything worse i also think they need to make it a lot easier for officers to report suspected misogyny among their colleagues more training would be good too police should make sure their ideas are informed by victims or groups like ourselves who are working on the ground were trusted in our community and we can help they should listen to us we want to hold them to account change the culture jess phillips shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding british policing needs to for the first time ever prioritise violence against women and girls and include it as serious violent crime with all the prevention strategies and resources that come with that womens complaints need to be handled better and more swiftly with proper support we also need more good oldfashioned community policing the police need to go out and be visibly in support of womenrecruiting more women police would help but it needs to be that when women police officers speak up they dont feel theyre risking their careers without a culture of transparency and whistleblowing and proper systems in place to make sure that complaints will be listened to were just encouraging more women to work in a difficult environment so there needs to be a cultural change within the police but the first thing they could do is take the crimes against us more seriously and not fail to take action against a police officer whos flashing at people earn our trust meena patel spokeswoman southall black sisters a nonprofit organisation supporting female victims of violence we see a lack of trust among women that the police will ever do anything victims need to be better informed about all actions that the police are taking and whats happening to their cases there are also problems about the way in which black and ethnic minority women are treated the police need to ensure they are supported as opposed to criminalising victims or asking them about immigration status id like to see the police engaging more with grassroots organisations like ourselves we could give them examples of good practice and show them how they should be helping women to feel safer police forces also need to demonstrate that they take robust action against officers when other officers complain about sexual assault or violence if female officers dont feel their complaints will be taken seriously why would women outside the force feel they can trust the police improve vetting susannah fish former chief constable of nottinghamshire who suffered sexual assaults from colleagues we need a public inquiry on a similar scale to the stephen lawrence inquiry and the home secretary needs to prioritise violence against women and girls as a national threat she should put it on the national risk register at the same level as terrorism and then provide resources accordingly the police selection process which is sexist racist and underresourced needs to change we need a vetting process that probes individuals online presence and a recruitment and promotion process that properly tests their values and behaviours victims should be put at the heart of the investigation process forces should commission more independent domestic abuse advocates they should investigate perpetrators not victims we also need to transform and support whistleblowing practices at the moment nothing stays secret and theyre rarely used especially by frontline officers who become vulnerable and isolated if they complain about a colleague,2021-10,compel action dame vera baird victim commissioner truly turn tide male violence woman girl need see government compel police act start

the polices response to reports of sexual offences such as indecent exposure has come into sharp focus following allegations that the met failed to investigate an accusation of indecent exposure from that could have identified wayne couzens as a sexual threat to women six years before the police officer murdered sarah everard the fallout further damages trust in the police to take sexual offences seriously an effect that can be clearly seen in statistics research shows that the overwhelming majority of victims do not report sexual offences such as harassment or indecent exposure and even when they do the vast majority of their reports do not result in any legal action against the alleged perpetrator setting aside rape the most serious sexual offence leaves a broad category of offences including unwanted touching and indecent exposure tracking these cases through the criminal justice system shows that fewer than of sexual offence experiences result in a conviction unwanted touching was the most common type of sexual offence experienced followed by indecent exposure according to the latest ons dataset analysing sexual offence cases in the criminal justice system what happens when people experience sexual offences rape is more clearly defined within the judicial system yet even in rape the most serious of sex crimes where the survivor lives after the event figures show the system by which we hold men to account for sexual violence against women is broken the fallout of the system is also reflected in how rape is treated by the criminal justice system which campaigners say can lead victims to question if there is any point in reporting lesser sexual crimes rape statistics of incidents of rape lead to a conviction most rapes happen in private places between people who already know one another prompting questions from people working in the field whether more police cctv and increased street lighting really get to the heart of the issue but reform of the police

the other morning my kindergartner woke me up by clambering onto the bed and stagewhispering hotly in my ear the mama is lost what the mama shes lost long pause as i squinted open my eyes and my brain started to crank awake from my dollhouse oh and from your house too kiddo i thought as i swung my feet over the side of the bed and staggered into the day as i pingponged about cladding my preschooler in a surgical mask for school in the park and making sure my kindergartners water bottle had a straw so she could drink under the face shield shes required to wear during lunch i thought back to this time last year at least then everything was so horrendous that it made obvious the decision of whether to entirely upheave our lives and move in with my parents answer yes even if it meant coming to terms with my mothers preferred babyproofing strategy which is to apply foam to all surfaces liberally turning each room into a big bumpered bowling alley these days as we head into our th month of recalibrating our new normal the fuzzy grayness of everything is causing even the most pragmatic of us to start to fray my friends text each other constantly finding solace in the fact that each of us is spinning out in her own way one of them calls it route recalculation is this going to be an everyhundredyear event or an everythreeyear event another asked me shes an ophthalmologist and mother of three one of the clearest thinkers i know who navigates surgeries school pickups and nursing with grace were doing delta now what happens when gamma comes around at least last year you knew what camp you were in you were strict or you were not strict for the first weeks of the pandemic after andrew cuomo shut down new york city my parents doctor prohibited them from crossing their door jamb my mother ever the rock would call me saying im walking two miles around the coffee table while listening to vivaldi but we were desperate to be together so when a friend called with the news that he had two cottages sidebyside on his property with our names on them we jumped at the chance what was supposed to be a few weeks of reunion turned into six months of isolating together much of it idyllic a multigenerational oasis was it all wonderful no but at least the stakes were obvious on a walk with my mother recently after we passed a man on a unicycle wearing large furry cat ears and a jumpsuit she said we all assumed this thing would be over that wed be back to normal life this fall but now that were all still wandering around in masks weve gone a little crazy am i going a little crazy im not wearing fuzzy cat ears yet but i whipsaw from the ecstasy of seeing my daughters cradle their new baby brother to erupting that dave has put the berries away in the wrong part of the fridge yes the baby came with accompanying maternal hormones but theyre just gasoline on a fire that is burning all on its own i contacted barry schwartz a psychologist who has spent much of his career exploring how the modern world plagues our psyche and who has written several books including the paradox of choice why more is less and practical wisdom the right way to do the right thing to get his take on my constant simmering crazy he started off our zoom with a quick psych lesson about the difference between fear and anxiety the terms are quite different but in popular discourse people dont make a distinction he said there is an object to fear you are afraid of something the thing of anxiety is youre afraid of everything you dont know what youre afraid of last year we feared the disease when we were told to lock down we locked down when i was told that if i didnt isolate with my parents i couldnt see them or else we might expose them to the disease and kill them we moved in together that fear has been replaced by anxiety which doesnt have a single culprit and in todays world that anxiety is amped up to i call it radical uncertainty because we cant attach odds to outcomes schwartz continued there is a sense that no matter how rational you try to be and no matter how much information you seek youre not able to reduce uncertainty that creates a kind of unease that is much much worse than before though the effects remain unknown schwartz is concerned that this seismic shift in our collective understanding of the world will result in lingering pathologies that may take years to play out in the interim hes doing his best to make risk calculations which in his case means seeing his grandkids but not going to the theater i acknowledge the risk is minuscule but theres no upside to justify it he told me what it comes down to is asking yourself what really matters and categorically rejecting everything else until things settle out its a hard line but a clear one and one that mitigates some of the uncertainty tradeoffs be damned we found the dollhouse mama before bed the other night shed somehow fallen into the bucket of stuffed animals where shed been floating around next to giant hedgehogs and bunnies the preschooler fished her out and promptly deposited her in the miniature bathroom where shes currently lying prostrate on the floor but at least shes home sophie

police forces should be compelled to deal with violence against women and girls with the same level of resources expertise and urgency as terrorism or organised crime the victims commissioner for england and wales has said after sarah everards killer was given a fulllife sentence on thursday campaigners said there was increasing frustration and the time for action was now vera baird said violence against women and girls should be made a strategic policing requirement to give the issue central direction and extra resources particularly for specialist officers so there was no doubt what obligations the police have towards victims she said there are many unanswered questions about how violence against women and girls is policed and i think if we have this clear requirement it sends a clear message that tackling it is a priority baird said requirements on agencies to fully investigate and take action in cases of violence against women could be included in the victims bill which the guardian understands was ready to be consulted on before the new justice secretary dominic raab took up his post without that it will just muddle on being ignored as if it were a lowlevel crime she said we have seen in this awful case that what is seen as lowlevel offending against women and girls can mark out a predatory attitude to them which can speedily escalate if not tackled the labour leader keir starmer led calls for an inquiry into how everards killer wayne couzens a metropolitan police officer who had been reported for indecent exposure on three occasions slipped through the cracks we have to understand why that happened and whether there were any assumptions made when his previous wrongdoing was looked at he said the labour mp yvette cooper went further calling for a full independent investigation into violence against women and girls within the police service the home secretary priti patel said there were serious questions that need to be answered by the metropolitan police while giving her backing to the met commissioner cressida dick the director of the good law project jolyon maugham called for a public inquiry into how cultural failings by the police and the broader criminal justice system contribute to the murder or rape of tens of thousands of women a year he said enough really is enough how many more women must die bairds call echoes the recommendation of a damning rootandbranch examination by her majestys inspectorate of constabulary and fire amp rescue services hmicfrs which found problems unevenness and inconsistencies in dealing with the epidemic of violence against female victims in the uk it was published as news emerged that sabina nessa a primary school teacher had been found dead in a park close to her south london home a man has appeared in court accused of her murder according to the counting dead women project run by karen ingala smith women were killed between the deaths of everard in march and nessa on september campaigners in the sector said there was a growing sense of anger and frustration that promises of change were not resulting in greater safety for women farah nazeer the chief executive of womens aid said a public inquiry into mens violence against women and girls would probably expose other institutional and government failings but was unlikely to lead to the action needed there was already a wealth of evidence and recommendations in the inspectorate of constabulary report the governments recently published violence against women and girls vawg strategy and rape review nazeer said we all know what needs to be done but making it a matter of priority choosing to prioritise funding into this area choosing to make that cultural shift these are political choices that were not making womens groups welcomed what some saw as an increased level of restraint in the reporting of couzens trial with many publications choosing not to feature a prominent photograph of the murderer while bbc radio s today programme chose to mention couzens by name sparingly in its reporting on thursday and included the full victim impact statement of everards mother susan we find that womens experience is lost so often when we talk about the impact of male violence against women and girls said jayne butler the chief executive of rape crisis england and wales we welcome that some outlets have chosen to focus their coverage on sarah andrea simon the director of the end violence against women coalition said that despite the reviews and promises of change since everards murder little had changed violence against women and girls is at an epidemic level the police inspectorate has said the whole system needs an overhaul the government has already apologised for the shameful low rates of prosecution of rape what more do we need to uncover we actually just need to move to doing something about it she said weve had all of these reviews and weve seen no material change we need to get on with actually making a difference now the minister for safeguarding rachel maclean said the government was committed to radically changing how violence against women and girls is tackled with a wholesystem approach

red my son shouts stuffing a large wet leaf into my hand as if hes trying to teach me something it is i must concede extremely red and a fine specimen at that firm flat and bigger than his head were collecting leaves for his nursery because well i dont know why my best bet is they use them to make art or dump them all on a table and talk about them maybe they load the leaves into an open brazier in the middle of the room gather round kids they say beckoning the waifs toward the heat with fingerless gloves before improvising a spit so they can roast a squirrel over it around lunch time whatever they do with the leaves he takes to these endeavours with the glee of a dedicated naturalist deriving the same joy from rummaging through piles of autumnal detritus that others might do from sports or cocaine and its a chance to school me on leaves a subject about which he clearly feels im ignorant certainly ive never picked a leaf hes chosen to bring in this ones nice i say proffering one id describe as perfect see i continue now desperate for his approval its yellow at this he flashes a patient pitying smile the kind a teacher might give a pupil whos started avidly eating the pencil hes just been handed before resuming the search for a yellow leaf less pathetic and embarrassing than my own still i say to my wife mildly wounded nice to get the last out of autumn the words have barely left my mouth before i realise what ive done dont start this she says since she does not consider november to be autumn at all she is from dublin and subscribes to the gaelic calendar by which autumn comprises august september and october whereas my northern irish schooling taught me the meteorological calendar with autumn as september october and november my wife and i have argued about many things during the blissful years weve spent together but none has recurred with such frequency and vehemence as her stubborn insistence that the calendar she was taught as a child makes sense the idea that autumn begins in august is itself so singularly demented that no further argument should be necessary but consider the knockon effects imagine if you can bear it the sanitywarping prospect that my wife and millions of irish people consider february to be springtime and may summer and you might begin to understand just how rancorous this disagreement can get were just about to launch into things when the boy comes bounding over with a giant yellow leaf perhaps he is trying to defuse the tension of a row that could yet end our marriage some day but its more likely hes trying

councils in england are looking for ways to provide housing for domestic abusers so their victims can stay in the family home in response to growing calls from some charities and campaigners the recently passed domestic abuse act requires councils to publish a strategy to provide housing support for victims and children some councils are now drafting plans that include housing for perpetrators along with measures for victims sunderland city councils draft strategy which is awaiting signoff says alternative accommodation should be made available for abusers women and their children should not have to leave their home women perceived this as disruptive for them and their children and unnecessary if safety plans can be put in place to protect themselves and their children women identified a key factor for their recovery would be provision of alternative accommodation for the perpetrator there have been growing calls for more ways to rehouse abusers including an open letter to the government last year a recent report from the domestic abuse housing alliance said that without the option to remove and rehouse a perpetrator victims including children will continue to suffer by remaining trapped in abusive relationships or being forced to flee their home the report said any such approach must be led and informed by the victim with risk assessment and management of the perpetrator it referred to cases where police and judges have been reluctant to issue domestic violence protection notices and orders in case they made the perpetrator homeless and other instances where abusers are housed in mixedsex homelessness accommodation alongside homeless abuse victims dorset council has put housing for perpetrators in its domestic abuse strategy such plans build on recent pilot schemes in london north yorkshire and the northeast however some organisations are sceptical of such initiatives isabelle younane head of policy campaigns and public affairs at womens aid said while staying in their homes may be the right choice for some women a woman may not feel safe in her own home as the perpetrator knows the address and could easily come back furthermore for many women this is not a possibility and the only option is to flee to a lifesaving refuge we also know that women frequently face complex expensive legal issues such as transferring a joint tenancy into their name when trying to remain at home and affordability is often an ongoing concern based on these and other challenges womens aid does not endorse funding this scheme while refuges remain hugely underfunded refuges are more than just a roof over a survivors head they provide vital holistic support community therapy financial stability and more yet despite the services that refuges provide women are still being turned away due to the lack of capacity and funding this gap must be adequately addressed to ensure women and childrens safety a local government association spokesperson said developing a comprehensive and effective perpetrator response is an integral part of preventing domestic abuse we firmly believe the right interventions at the right time can stop abuse from occurring recurring or escalating we would like to see this prioritised at a government level and eagerly await the governments national domestic abuse strategy which is expected to have an emphasis on perpetrator interventions we would also support crossdepartmental efforts to addressing perpetrator accommodation options so that the abusive partner is removed and victims are not forced to leave their own homes for their safety a government spokesperson said we are committed to radically changing how we end violence against women by supporting survivors and pursuing perpetrators committing m this year to hold them to account the duties in the domestic abuse act are about providing the right support to victims and their children who need to find safe accommodation rather than supporting perpetrators we would expect perpetrators to make their own living arrangements however councils have statutory duties to prevent and relieve homelessness ensuring that help and advice is provided to

any parent of a newborn knows its hard to stay awake let alone focus on anything else maternity leave matters its good for our health our children and our economy it is a peculiarity of our legislature that as an mp i dont have any employment rights we might make laws but we dont impose these particular ones on ourselves consequently i found myself high on morphine speaking to ministers about afghanistan having just given birth to my second child to ensure my constituents concerns could be heard although it is illegal to require a woman to work in the first two weeks after childbirth no maternity cover meant that with three murders heavy flooding and a costofliving crisis it was simply not possible to switch off my email or my phone parliament denied me maternity cover on the basis that democracy demands no one else can substitute for me with little support from the authorities or indeed my own political party i have worked as best i can while managing the needs of my now weekold son thats why i was baffled to be told i could not take him into parliament with me while my son slept blissfully calmed by the excitement only discussion of financial regulation can generate his presence at a debate clearly vexed some in an institution that had previously seemed relaxed about such matters it now transpires the newly revised commons rule book specifies children cannot go into the chambers thus parliament has to date put more effort into writing rules about this than second jobs some argue it is a privilege to take your kids to the office and it is out of touch to suggest this should be acceptable whatever the effect of being denied this flexibility others recognise this as making an already difficult combination of caring commitments near impossible whether the provision of maternity cover or rules about where children can go with some mps berated for taking toddlers into the tea room between votes these courtesies and customs have evolved rather than been designed to meet modern times its a chickenandegg situation few mothers of young children get elected meaning there is little need to reconsider these rules in the first place challenging this is not about me frankly it is too late to recoup the precious early weeks with my son those who suffer the most are the residents of my walthamstow constituency denied a voice in parliament by antiquated rules met by a tired and frazzled mum in their constituency so too the brilliant women who decide either to delay their political careers or abandon them so that our politics misses a source of talent while we accept this status quo were i to have employment rights i could invoke my legal right not to be discriminated against while breastfeeding and to have appropriate maternity cover meaning i could take maternity leave yet such rights are no guarantee employers will uphold them during the pandemic many mothers especially those on low incomes and from minority community backgrounds were the first to be furloughed or made redundant and are now struggling to find childcare as providers have gone out of business it is welcome that the speaker has asked the procedures committee to investigate but it is not clear yet how long that will take or indeed what its remit will be meanwhile political parties are gearing up to select candidates for the next general election offering the opportunity to ensure more mothers have a seat at the decisionmaking table together with the charity pregnant then screwed we have set up the this mum votes project to champion policies to help parents in all workplaces including paid parental leave and universal childcare and to fund mothers to stand for office to argue for them it doesnt have to be like this whether in new zealand canada or in europe parliaments around the world have shown a familyfriendly legislature is possible there are thousands of mothers out there who have something valuable to add to our politics and they want to run for now they see the mother of all parliaments discouraging mothers and rightly wonder if they will be welcome stella creasy is the labour mp for walthamstow,2021-11,parent newborn know hard

if youre a survivor of male violence reading lucy kirkwoods howl of a play maryland is a visceral experience to hear it out loud i imagine even more so the observers theatre critic susannah clapp described the experience of attending a reading at the royal court as only the second time in years in the stalls that i and another critic female have clutched each other in fright maryland was written in two days after the killing of school teacher sabina nessa months after sarah everard had been raped and murdered by a police officer and in the year that two metropolitan police officers pleaded guilty to misconduct after sharing photos of the murdered sisters nicole smallman and bibaa henry on a whatsapp group the officers have now been sacked maryland is minutes of pure anger and what woman hasnt felt angry this year about the continued toll that male violence takes upon our lives marylands chorus of furies at least three but is better the script advises could be any one of us not all men they chant but if i gave you a box of maltesers and told you two of them werent maltesers they were very small balls of human shit would you feel a bit anxious while you were eating or would you just crack on the word rape meanwhile is obscured by a scarcely human scream an unbearable noise a metaphor for the unspeakable pain and fear it wreaks on so many womens lives maryland sold out when it was performed in an extended run at the royal court in october usually with contemporary drama that would probably be the end of it for a while but kirkwood has waived performance rights for november meaning anybody can perform it this month with the result that amazingly maryland is being performed all over the country from cardiff to edinburgh manchester to brighton newcastle to north wales its furious words spoken by many different women its message ricocheting and resonating across the land in a startling act of resistance donations towards survivors charities are encouraged in a way that resembles how benefit performances of the vagina monologues have been performed globally feminist theatre has always had radical potential prompting as it does what used to be called consciousness raising the hope being that audience members leave a performance determined to enact change committed to speaking out look how the play has galvanised theatre makers all over britain bridget foreman tells me she is directing the play for yorks riding lights theatre company which is staging readings this friday at the friargate theatre we want to shout to protest we want audiences to go out and do the same in their way in their families workplaces friendship groups we want far more than ripples of applause we really believe that this play can stir people to change how they think about what is and isnt acceptable behaviour and what they can do about it marylands furious echoes are a powerful argument for relaxing rights to works that confront social issues so that they can be seen by diverse and geographically diffuse audiences at the heart of kirkwoods play is an understanding of how male violence and the experience of it can manifest differently among women with certain lines being reserved for women of colour such as because if your bruises dont show like a caucasian you are not believed like a caucasian and if i was attacked and left for dead i cannot guarantee that the police would not take photographsselfies with my dead body from its beginnings feminist theatre appreciated the importance of firstperson testimony kirkwood says that everything in the play is based on reallife events in the s my mother was part of the feminist theatre group resisters no relation to the current campaigning group of the same name embroiled in the trans rights debate a multicultural cooperative of women who used personal experience of male violence to create shows including with women in refuges some of the selfdefence she learned with resisters she passed on to me and in the autumn of when i was attacked it saved my life proof if you need it of how such groups can affect change in our lives feminist theatre was thriving then in the s and s in london thanks to funding from the glc before it was abolished by margaret thatcher and its resonances live on in art and literature bernardine evaristos phenomenally successful girl woman other draws on that period of activist theatre and on black womens experiences the section about the gang rape of a schoolgirl remains one of the most powerful distressing evocations i have ever read rebecca watsons novel little scratch about a woman trying to go about her day in the aftermath of a rape has been adapted into a play at hampstead theatre could we be seeing another wave of resistance the dissemination of maryland seems to indicate that we might these days there is a far more mainstream understanding of the mechanisms and manifestations of police violence than there were even when i was younger as a result of black lives matter and a number of highprofile cases that have seen women and their allies react in fury as foreman says realworld change starts at a grassroots level if criminals can hide in the police force then individuals need to come together to raise their voices in outrage and in protest theatre helps us imagine such protests theatre helps us to imagine change

the house of commons will review rules that led to the labour mp stella creasy being reprimanded for bringing her baby to parliament while she spoke at a debate the speaker has announced creasy asked for urgent clarification from commons authorities after being reprimanded for having her infant son in a sling as she spoke in parliament on tuesday saying this had not been a problem on other occasions commons rules state that mps should not have children or infants with them in the chamber but creasy has taken both her children into the commons before without complaint without maternity cover the residents of walthamstow would be denied representation if i didnt keep working but anyone with a threemonthold baby knows they are too young to leave on their own she told the guardian on wednesday the walthamstow mp brought her threemonthold son in a sling as she led a debate about buynowpaylater consumer credit schemes on tuesday afternoon in westminster hall a subsidiary chamber in the commons after an outcry when creasy posted an email she had received telling her that her sons presence was against the rules the speaker sir lindsay hoyle asked the commons procedure committee chaired by karen bradley to look at the rules it is extremely important that parents of babies and young children are able to participate fully in the work of this house he said saying he had been unaware of the advice given to creasy until last night however rules have to be seen in context and they change with the times he said i accept there are differing views on this matter indeed i have been contacted by honourable members who have babies with a range of views creasy said she had received an email from the commons authorities saying the latest edition of rules of behaviour and courtesies in the house of commons the handbook for mps says they should not take their seat in the commons while with a child this edition published in september states that mps can take babies or toddlers with them through the lobbies to vote and if needed through the commons to do so but adds you should not take your seat in the chamber when accompanied by your child nor stand at either end of the chamber between divisions politicians have rallied in support of creasy with the deputy prime minister dominic raab saying he had a lot of sympathy speaking on bbc breakfast on wednesday raab said the profession of mp needed to be brought into the modern world the st century and can allow parents to juggle the jobs they do with the family time that they need the former leader of the scottish conservative party ruth davidson gave examples of the support she had received at holyrood after the birth of her son finn which included a note from the presiding officer of the scottish parliament the scottish equivalent of the speaker assuring her that her baby was welcome on the estate if it helps to know how other parliaments around the uk operate stellacreasy before i came back to work the chief exec amp po got in touch to ask what i needed i got a fridge for my office for storing breast milk amp to reassure me finn was welcome on the estate amp in the chamber she wrote however the mp received only lukewarm words from the partys spokesman after creasy said she felt unsupported by labour keir starmers spokesman said it would be inappropriate for me to comment while the procedure committee is considering what it wants to do asked if starmer has any personal views he said you can clearly see we are supportive when it comes to wanting people to be able to juggle their work and caring responsibilities asked about creasy feeling unsupported by fellow mps including her own party he said youll have to speak stella about that creasy who also has a young daughter has battled to ensure mps can have proper maternity cover the law prevents a locum from being able to cover the parliamentary work of mps on parental leave the mp has also launched a campaign called

tens of thousands of selfemployed women who took maternity leave were indirectly discriminated against by the uk government during the pandemic but will be unable to claim rebates from a government

about women who took maternity leave between and lost out on earnings because payments from the selfemployment income support scheme seiss introduced after the furlough scheme last year are worked out using average profits the campaign group pregnant then screwed brought a publicly funded judicial review supported by the musicians union the federation of entertainment unions and the union community against the chancellor rishi sunak arguing that giving birth could not be compared to taking a holiday or other planned work breaks and fell foul of equality laws by only affecting women the payments calculated by taking into account of selfemployed profits averaged out between and did not exempt periods when selfemployed women were not earning because they were on maternity leave or take into account statutory maternity payments earlier this year the high court ruled that seiss was not discriminatory but this was partly overturned by the court of appeal on wednesday thousands of women will be unable to claim rebates however after three judges ruled that the nature of the pandemic meant it would have been impossible to amend the scheme without affecting its speed simplicity or verifiability kerry chamberlain a selfemployed energy analyst who acted as a claimant in the case took maternity leave in and she estimates that she missed out on the biggest frustration was that this was a calculation that was supposed to compensate fairly for your actual loss of earnings but it wasnt fair because they didnt count in the last full tax year when my earnings had returned to normal zo challenor the founder of the childrens opera company bopera said her selfemployed household lost all work and income overnight in march challenor whose children are six and four had been working four days a week in but her seiss payment was based on earnings in when she was on maternity leave and then looking after a small child under the furlough scheme she would have received of her wages but instead she got a week about of her income when the pandemic hit that didnt come close to covering my mortgage or basic bills like food she said and this is in the context that many selfemployed mothers will have already taken a huge financial hit and career setback to take unpaid time off to have children in the first place joeli brearley the chief executive and founder of pregnant then screwed said she was delighted at the ruling of indirect sex discrimination and said it should act as a reminder to the government of its legal obligation to ensure no policies disproportionately affect any group unless it can be justified the fact that women who have taken a period of maternity leave to do the most important job in the world raising the next generation are then subject to a lower payment is quite clearly discrimination she said brierly said there was a blindness at the heart of government to womens needs with ministers only considering the impact of the scheme on new mothers in late april after the charity raised it in parliament and through a legal challenge supported by doughty street chambers and the law firm leigh day asked about the issue in parliament sunak

the labour mp stella creasy has asked for urgent clarification from commons authorities after being reprimanded for having her infant son in a sling as she spoke in parliament on tuesday saying this had not been a problem on other occasions while commons rules state that mps should not have children or infants with them in the chamber creasy has taken both her children into the commons before without any complaints being made the walthamstow mp led a debate about buynowpaylater consumer credit schemes on tuesday afternoon in westminster hall a subsidiary chamber where mps can raise issues of interest to them she later tweeted an email she had received from commons authorities we have been made aware that you were accompanied by your baby in westminster hall earlier today it read from the private secretary to the chairman of ways and means which is the formal title for the most senior deputy speaker currently the conservative mp eleanor laing the email pointed out that the latest edition of rules of behaviour and courtesies in the house of commons the handbook for mps says they should not take their seat in the commons while with a child adding i would like to draw your attention to the fact that this also applies to debates in westminster hall this edition of the rules published in september states that mps can take babies or toddlers with them through the lobbies to vote and if needed through the commons to do so but adds you should not take your seat in the chamber when accompanied by your child nor stand at either end of the chamber between divisions the same wording was also in the previous version of the rules however creasy has taken her children into the commons before without reprimand on september with her thennewborn son in a sling she asked jacob reesmogg the commons leader if he would consider revising other rules which mean that mps on parental leave must give up the proxy vote they are permitted if they want to speak occasionally in the chamber reesmogg defended the rules but told creasy he wanted to congratulate her on the impeccable behaviour of her infant after creasys tweet another labour mp alex daviesjones tweeted that the rule seemed a complete contradiction given that when she was breastfeeding her child the commons speaker lindsay hoyle assured her that if the need arose i would be able to feed my child in the chamber or westminster hall creasy who also has a young daughter has battled to ensure mps can have proper maternity cover but without success so far she has tussled with the independent parliamentary standards authority to get a locum paid near to her own salary rate to cover her constituency casework the law prevents a locum from being able to cover the parliamentary work of mps on parental leave more recently creasy launched a campaign called this mum votes originally named vote mama uk after an existing us campaign to help support parents in politics saying she did not think her own party had properly backed her push for maternity rights creasy who says she has been assured the email was not prompted by a complaint from an mp told the guardian she was baffled by what had happened without maternity cover the residents of walthamstow would be denied representation if i didnt keep working but anyone with a threemonthold baby knows they are too young to leave on their own she said having already taken my baby into the chamber previously without any complaint ive asked for urgent clarification as to what would happen if i keep bringing the baby with me and where they expect me to leave him issues like this are why we have set up the this mum votes project so we can ensure that the mother of all parliaments ensured mothers can be seen and heard in our politics a house of commons spokesperson said it is vital that all democratically elected mps are able to carry out their duties in and around parliament members can at any time consult with the speaker deputy speakers

after five years of stayathome parenting i returned to paid labour this year during interviews my potential employers referred to my halfdecade of caring as time off one described it as a prolonged spell away from the workforce as if my brain was extracted in the birthing suite back in and frozen in a cryogenic vessel until further notice and when was the last time you managed a team a young graphic designer asked me over zoom this morning i replied my childrens screams still ricocheting around my temporal lobe oh great can you tell me more about that sure my fiveyearold was wailing because we were running late for kinder and my threeyearold was refusing to get down from the top bunk i injured my back last time and the hose doesnt reach that far so i decided to change tack sorry i mean a team at work do you mean paid work yeah five years ago i inhaled slowly through my nose and readied myself for the next question ive breastfed two babies through the night next to a snoring partner im excellent at metabolising rage in the first episode of netflixs maid alex played by margaret qualley escapes an abusive relationship with her young daughter and tries to find a job a support services manager asks her if she has any special skills the vision cuts to a flashback of alex and her child on a gentle morning beach no she replies alex learns of her limited career and housing options and takes a job as a cleaner to make ends meet if employers recognised parenting as a special skill maid would be a very different show for starters it wouldnt be called maid but rather project manager strategy lead or warehouse team leader it would still be centred around a woman who leaves an abusive relationship only she would land a job that pays enough to cover food housing and childcare how would you manage a dissatisfied client continued the graphic designer through my computer screen id remind them that they just ate and that dinner was almost ready but if they were really really hungry they could have an apple slice when they started to scream id stop what i was doing and crouch to meet their eyes stare into the abyss of human wanting and blow a raspberry on their neck id serve them a wholesome meal and watch as they pulled it apart and threw it on the floor only to say an hour later how hungry they were whimpering softly in bed apparently weak with starvation id bring them an apple slice and sit them up until theyd finished it to ensure they didnt choke before returning to the kitchen to salvage what i could id pass on their feedback to the account manager i answered there are articles on how parenting skills apply to the workplace many refer to them as mum skills and are accompanied by images of grinning women scooting children down hallways in laundry baskets some list time management and planning as separate categories and encourage parents to list driving children to and from engagements as an example of each on their cv other articles implore businesses to hire more primary carers and list quotes from ceos about parents impeccable leadership skills grit and creativity they position parents as multitasking superheroes who are guaranteed to improve a companys bottom line i think the truth lies somewhere in the middle primary carers make exceptional employees but they often require additional support were like the

on thursday morning i sent my mother a whatsapp message entertaining discussion on radio about how its better being a grandmother than a mother i wrote she didnt reply it is not easy being a son on the today programme amol rajan and sheila hancock had been discussing a study by anthropologists in atlanta georgia which found that grandmothers may be more emotionally connected to their grandchildren than their children the researchers showed women pictures of their biological grandchildren the childs parents and random children and adults and watched the effect it had on their brains when the grandmothers looked at the grandchildren the part of their brain associated with cognitive empathy lit up we dont know which part of the brain lit up when they saw their children have scientists even identified the part associated with contempt and regret the brain scanner was unnecessary anyway the evidence is everywhere at the sight of a grandchild the heart of even the sternest british matriarch and i must say here very clearly that i am not referring to my own mother turns to puree women who have never exactly been profligate with affection again mum not you become cooing cuddling gaga machines were i referring to my own mother here i might talk about how the beaming woman who welcomes my daughter with popcorn tv and repeated use of the words poppet and darling is so unrecognisable to her own children that i sometimes wonder if she is being impersonated talented mr ripleystyle by an outofwork primary schoolteacher but to be clear i am not referring to my own mother one theory behind the grandchildren empathy is that the love of grandparents helps improve the grandchilds chance of survival it certainly improves their chances of treats the obvious explanation for these superior vibes is that the time grandparents spend with their grandchildren is usually voluntary and filled with highstatus activities such as games and trips to the zoo rather than parent drudgery such as discipline and vegetables it is as though the management consultants have been in and ruthlessly stripped out all the worst parts of parenting nappies and homework no icecream yes just when you think things cannot get better for the boomers something like this comes along all parents are tories not capital t although obviously there are a few of those around but their ambitions for their children born of terror tend to the conservative get a sensible job wear warm jumpers be happy grandparents are anarchists by comparison eat that junk food stay up late go to the park without being swaddled like an early arctic explorer itll be fine it would be nice to think that grandparents are more chilled out because they have gone round the course already one obvious but overlooked aspect is that to have grandchildren you typically will have had children first after the frenzy of parenting where you somehow take on this project at the same time as trying not to get sacked and redo the kitchen maybe you come to grandparenting with a clearer sense of priorities after picking your children up for years eventually you put them down for ever as a grandparent you can appreciate these everyday joys without worrying so much about gcse results or recorder practice a bit of detachment can lead to more rational decisions whats more when they become grandparents your parents can complain about your parental neuroses while conveniently forgetting that they gave you those neuroses in the first place winwin sadly im not sure its true eventually my mother replies as a parent you have great power at least for a bit and can determine if your child supports arsenal goes to church watches tv learns ballet as a grandparent you dont have this power she adds with only a hint of regret its a junior role the jobs cant be compared with a child youre programmed to look after it or it will be eaten by wolves with grandchildren you just have to return them in one piece its like being a slightly more involved babysitter grandparents also dont have to worry as much about the overall outcome in the normal course of things by the time your grandchildren are old enough to have become truly disappointing you will be on your way out before that youll have had your children to look after you in your dotage at least we are still good for

toxic cultural practices and a lack of culturally sensitive services means many women who are victims of domestic and sexual abuse in the sikh community are suffering in silence according to the first comprehensive report into the issue the report by sikh womens aid swa the uks only frontline service for sikh women will be released later this week to coincide with the launch of the united nations womens annual days of activism against genderbased violence it creates a harrowing picture of the prevalence and effect of domestic abuse and child sexual abuse in the sikh community the research was carried out over a fourmonth period over the summer during which time swa distributed anonymous surveys within the community across the uk researchers received replies from almost respondents and of those said they had experienced domestic abuse nearly half had experienced incidents with more than one perpetrator including female members of their family over a third of respondents said that they had experienced child sexual abuse and of these incidents one in seven involved more than one perpetrator most victims knew their abuser and nearly half of the incidents of abuse took place at home gender equality is one of the core beliefs of the sikh faith but says the swa patriarchal societal practices stemming from cultural traditions such as concepts of honour mean that many survivors are afraid to speak out awareness of these issues is growing however following several highprofile cases including the murder of yearold ranjit gill from milton keynes earlier this year she was stabbed times by her dominating and bullying husband anil gill in an alcohol and cocainefuelled attack while domestic and sexual abuse affect all ethnicities cultures and backgrounds the founders of sikh womens aid and authors of the report sahdaish pall and sukhvinder kaur said that a lack of specialist support that met the needs of women in the sikh community was creating a generation of young women who are completely lost the findings of the report will be used by swa to create services tailored to the specific needs and cultural nuances that victims of abuse within the sikh panjabi community face out of all the south asian communities sikh women are the least likely to come forward about abuse we come across as a very affluent educated and giving community and that reputation makes it very difficult for sikh women to come forward said pall there are issues specific to our culture like the link between alcohol and domestic and sexual violence we have a huge drinking culture among men and the amounts people consume exacerbate issues there is also a lack of education around things like coercive control the parental generations view is if you havent been beaten up thats not abuse theres often an intergenerational and toxic normalisation and acceptance of violence against women the taboo around discussing sexual abuse is particularly widespread and issues such as victimshaming and cultural concepts of honour and shame which have no basis in religious teachings are often weaponised against victims to ensure their silence nimrit from london who was abused by her uncle between the ages of eight and said that her familys fear of not finding a good husband for her meant she had to stay silent about her abuse from the outside we looked like the perfect family but behind closed doors was another story my uncle was a pillar of the community who was active in the gurdwara sikh place of worship he would come and stay at our house and during those visits he would abuse me she said eventually i told my cousin and made her promise not to tell anyone but she told her mum who told my mum my mum slapped my face and began sobbing and saying who will marry you now she said if i wasnt a virgin i would have to get married straight away so i lied and said he only touched me we had to keep it a secret from my dad because it was her brother and to this day he hasnt a clue it kills me when i hear him saying nice things about my uncle she continued i had to keep it a secret to protect the family but secrets like that eat you up inside a guy from uni once tapped my shoulder to get my attention and i screamed in his face i had an arranged marriage and the physical side of the relationship was hard as i got flashbacks but i couldnt tell my husband about my past so i just shut down im just trying to live a normal life there is more awareness about these issues in the community now compared to when i was a kid but people need to speak out without being punished for it or the abuse wont stop sexual abuse in the sikh community is almost like the perfect crime according to sukhvinder kaur because the likelihood of someone being prosecuted is so low not only is there a lack of convictions but the community is geared towards protecting the reputation of perpetrators she said one of the most sensitive issues the report tackles is grooming the report found that the widely held perception within the community that the majority of victims of sexual abuse were exploited by nonsikh grooming gangs is false this finding in particular has led to a backlash against the reports authors there is more abuse taking place where the perpetrator is known to the victim and the family our community is in denial about that said kaur dame vera baird the victims commissioner for england and wales who will be at the official launch of the report later this week said that it highlighted the need for culturally appropriate support organisations for black asian and other minority women who are neglected by the criminal justice system and in the provision of specialist support i welcome this report although it is hard to do that when it shows that there is rampant hidden violence against women and girls in the sikh community she said former chief prosecutor nazir afzal added its a testament to the courage of swa that we have this report at all given the hostility they have faced nothing in this report should surprise anyone involved in safeguarding any strategy that focuses on what men should do rather than on male violence will always fail any successful response will involve addressing male power while simultaneously supporting victims not her real name,2021-11,toxic cultural practice lack culturally sensitive service mean many woman

imagine gathering the strength and courage to report an incident of domestic abuse to the police only to be told that it is too late for them to take any action you have been timed out theres nothing they can do this is what is happening to thousands of domestic abuse victims every year when they discover that a sixmonth time limit applies to their case the law isnt working and it is part of a wider failure of the criminal justice system to properly recognise or tackle violence against women and girls a crucial vote in parliament on monday provides the opportunity to change the law now we need the government to show its support figures show that over the past five years police in england and wales dropped close to domestic abuse cases because they ran out of time as a result of a sixmonth limit on prosecuting common assault cases in magistrates courts the full figures are likely to be much higher and the problem is getting worse with more victims being timed out every year the ostensible purpose of the time limit is to keep the justice system moving for lowerlevel offences in the magistrates courts that dont pass the threshold for crown court charges have to be laid within six months of the offence so that cases can be decided quickly and everyone can move on but while that might make sense for a fight in a pub or an assault by a stranger in the street it simply doesnt work for domestic abuse there are countless reasons why victims of domestic abuse may take time to report assaults to the police the abuse may be continuing leaving may be emotionally hard or fraught with physical danger victims may feel ashamed they may have nowhere to go or no money with which to leave there may be children who need time and support to resettle victims have to muster a huge amount of courage to go to the police for them to then be told nothing will happen can leave them feeling more vulnerable than ever while their abuser is emboldened while it is true that the most serious cases can still be prosecuted as actual bodily harm through a crown court where there is no time limit or through the more recent law on coercive control vast numbers of domestic abuse cases every year are ruled to not meet that higher threshold police officers have told me of their frustration trying to secure an actual bodily harm prosecution against a violent perpetrator only to be told by the crown prosecution service that it should be downgraded to common assault instead but too often by that time it is too late and the perpetrator walks free the consequence is that once again the criminal justice system is failing to recognise the reality of violence against women and girls laws and procedures designed to tackle other kinds of assault just dont work for domestic abuse but there has been a blindness to the experiences of abuse victims that has seen the problem continue for far too long earlier this year i proposed an amendment to change the existing law removing the sixmonth limit for domestic abuse cases to give victims more time to come forward on monday the former victims commissioner baroness newlove will take the amendment forward in the house of lords in advance of the debate and together with violence against women experts we have written to the home secretary asking her to accept our amendment it has support from the domestic abuse commissioner senior police officers refuge womens aid and the centre for womens justice rightly the government has promised stronger action to tackle violence against women and girls monday will be an opportunity to put this promise into action this law change could make the difference in getting thousands of survivors and victims of abuse across the country each year the justice and the protection they need too many have been let down such as the incredible campaigner erica osakwe who spoke out about her own experience to try to get the law changed or the brave woman in my constituency who reported appalling abuse to the police only to be told the investigation had run out of time and there was nothing more she could do victims have shown huge strength in coming forward only to find their chance of justice stolen by the time limit giving the perpetrator the chance to abuse once more its time to change the law on monday we must not let survivors and victims down again yvette cooper is the labour mp for normanton pontefract and castleford in the uk call the national domestic abuse helpline on or visit womens aid this article was amended on november the law applies in england and wales

police forces will put a relentless focus on perpetrators in an attempt to tackle soaring levels of violence against women and girls according to the new national police lead speaking at the national police chiefs councils npcc and association of police and crime commissionerss joint conference on thursday maggie blyth the deputy chief constable of hampshire police who was appointed into the new role of national police lead for violence against women and girls five weeks ago acknowledged that trust between women and the police had been broken through some of the tragic events of the last few weeks and months blyth said she had put together a twoyear plan to transform how forces tackle crimes against women and girls after the deaths of sabina nessa and sarah everard and the conviction of a serving police officer for everards killing our first focus our first pillar is on the relentless focus of perpetrators and our policing response very much around perpetrators she said the perpetratorfocused approach is currently being piloted in avon and somerset and involves attempting to disrupt and track suspected sex offenders including rapists instead of focusing on the credibility of victims blyth was appointed in september after a highly critical report from the police watchdog which warned that england and wales was facing a national epidemic of violence against women and girls she told officers at the conference that police needed to act quickly to rebuild trust and said there were immediate police improvements that mean that action is needed in the next few weeks straight away the police were very much in listening mode and thats really important because of the dip in trust and confidence she said adding we wont move forward at all in any of our policing work and our wider partnership work on violence against women and girls if we dont make a change and rebuild that trust that we know has been broken through some of the tragic events of the last few weeks and months that work had to focus on culture and conduct and behaviour she added during a panel discussion on violence against women and girls which noted that the murder of sarah everard by a serving police officer has prompted widespread concerns about womens safety and male violence as well as raising serious questions about culture vetting and recruitment across the service the victims commissioner dame vera baird made a direct challenge to the assembled officers she said the treatment of violence against women and girls in the police had no central direction no central resourcing but it does kill a woman every three days baird called for a overhaul in police culture for more status to be given to officers specialised in tackling violence against women and for vawg to become a strategic policing priority like terrorism to give the issue central direction and extra resources particularly for specialist officers ask yourselves after reports and years of womens voices raised against violence against women and girls why are you still not policing it properly she said dont you owe it to the public to see that and to change culturally around by degrees and start to lead us out of this epidemic of violence against women and girls it comes after a yougov poll on behalf of the end violence against women evaw coalition found of women and of men said their trust in the police had dropped since the conviction of everards killer wayne couzens about one in three said they continued to trust the police evaws director andrea simon told officers we are concerned there has been a comparatively swift leap towards various initiatives which seem aimed at improving public perception of policing before substantive transformation and improvement in our criminal justice

at two in the morning the other day i found myself swaying slowly from side to side cradling my preschooler and whispersinging the oompa loompa song from willy wonka like a lullaby per her barked instructions like most parents im particularly fixated on sleep and how to optimize it as i drew out the jiglike tune to make it as soporific as possible the kindergartner whimpering from the top bunk and the preschooler occasionally flashing me a sadistic grin i was pretty certain i wasnt optimizing anything except for the likelihood that when we did eventually nod off wed all dream about tiny orange men the preschooler due to a combination of covid and minimal square footage happily slept the first two years of her life in a pack n play in our closet but when the girls started clamoring to sleep in the bunk bed together i entertained visions of prebed whispering that would render grownup involvement moot and strengthen their sisterly bonds while leading to deeper sleep all around plus i assumed sleeping together in piles was hardwired into us from the days when we sought safety from roaming mastodons so i put the bumper on the bottom bunk and figured whats the worst that can happen im cowering on the floor of their room my husband dave texted the first night a full hour after bedtime my arm fell asleep so i had to put her down now she wont let me leave pulsing ellipse then im so hungry i tiptoed in to relieve him as he scurried out to scarf down dinner two full minutes of silence a cackle from the top bunk im having the funniest dream ever mama my kindergartner shrieked i lay down on the floor the preschooler popped up like a prairie dog no lying down mama she bellowed a pintsized sigourney weaveraszuul in ghostbusters over the course of the next few weeks we tried everything crying it out not crying it out playing the silent game a sticker chart the promise of any breakfast they could dream up including straight up a bowl of sprinkles nothing worked theyd chatter and play until way past bedtime then wake each other up multiple times each night at the end of a particularly grueling stretch the preschooler declared that she no longer cared about stickers or sprinkles a scorched earth negotiating tactic straight out of genghis khans playbook i nearly fell to the floor weeping set aside whatever parental judgment you may harbor about the rights and wrongs of bargaining chips not holding the line and acquiescing to fruitless and idiotic demands oomparelated or other the bigger question in my mind was whether my end goal two happy kiddos calming each others anxiety and sleeping deeply because of it was worthy considering we were no longer sharing the tundra with predators and we had the space to opt out if we wanted the research and advice about bed sharing was all over the place and the data about room sharing nearly nonexistent some studies i read concluded that sharing a room or bed could maximize remstage sleep others concluded that doing so would do the opposite i learned crazy facts like that birds can shut half their brain off to sleep and keep the other half awake and if theyre all hanging out in a line the ones on the edges will have half their brains awake while the ones in the middle will be fully asleep oh to be a middleofthepack pigeon on a telephone pole i thought as i curled up in the fetal position on the floor by the bunk bed acquiescing to whatever commands were coming from above if you asked me what was the best way to get the best nights sleep it would be everyone separate in their preferred environment dr haviva veler director of the weill cornell pediatric sleep and breathing disorders center told me when i reached her by phone so much for my mastodon theory various anthropologists surmise our circadian rhythms evolved to differ you might be a night owl your spouse a lark because if more people are waking up at various intervals it minimizes the chances that every single person will be snoozing the moment a predator lopes by of course as anyone can tell you who enjoys a prebed snuggle or chat thats not the whole story we dont live in a vacuum and theres the emotional part the psychological effects of sharing a space at nighttime veler continued numerous sleep researchers told me that calming anxiety is the number one reason to throw siblings together and others brought up that it might have less to do with sleep quality than it does with values i expect you to share a room i expect you to be a flexible person youre saying in effect and the psychological effects often pass down from generation to generation my friend who shared a room for years with her two younger sisters is now forcing her two young children to sleep together actual sleep be damned this despite the existence of a third bedroom and a very practical husband who calmly points out as one or the other child starts shrieking in the middle of the night that they could bypass allhouse wakeups should they so choose i dont really know that its making them any better at sharing or any more tolerant of soundsdisturbances while sleeping she emailed me but i almost dont really care at this point because it makes me so happy to wake up and find both of them in their cribs smiling up at me or simultaneously cryscreaming as is sometimes the case dr veler has had parents come to her trying to figure out why their children fall asleep just fine together but wake up in the middle of the night it has to do with the concept of sleep association or what you need in order to fall asleep or get back to sleep quickly if you wake up for me thats a pitchdark room an icecold climate and dave not moving or breathing audibly something which has resulted in him dutifully affixing breath right strips to his nose to assuage middleofthenight snores its like an oxygen wind tunnel in there hell say morose as he curls into the fetal position and settles in for a long night of trying to remain immobile lest he provoke my nocturnal rage we figured out that part of their sleep association was chatting with their sibling veler said but when they didnt have them in the middle of the night they couldnt get back to sleep which is adorable albeit not at two in the morning velers recommendation separate the kids so they can start a new sleep association then reunite them if you so choose so though the girls begged to stay in their bunk bed i laid down the law our household sleep strategy moving forward would be to maximize remstage sleep at the expense of all emotional closeness it worked fine until daylight savings time that most dreaded celestial corrective which was probably the cause of the preschooler waking up at random hours of the night and so i found myself once again cradling her and whispersinging the oompa loompa song until her breathing calmed then id tiptoe back to my room where the steady sound of daves clear nasal passages would lull me to bed i knew wed wake each other up shortly but fat chance id rethink my nighttime environment in favor of something as clinical as optimizing sleep sophie brickman is a contributor to the new yorker the new york

the governments muchhyped information campaign targeting perpetrators of violence against women will not be launched until next year the observer has learned this comes just as new research indicates the vast majority of females have experienced unwanted violent aggressive or sexual behaviours on uk public transport as part of the home secretarys strategy to tackle violence against women and girls launched in july priti patel promised a multimillion communications campaign with a focus on targeting perpetrators and harmful misogynistic attitudes however concern is growing that the campaign will not be up and running until with sources saying it remains at a concept stage more than three months after it was unveiled the delay means it will not be launched until after christmas a period that tends to witness a rise in domestic violence but also comes against a backdrop of concerted calls for the government to start prioritising measures to tackle violence against women and girls when it comes to domestic abuse you see increases around holiday periods and we know the christmas party season can be fraught with dangers said mp and chair of the women and equalities select committee caroline nokes so if i was the government id be looking at the opportunities right now and thinking this could be a really good time to launch a public awareness campaign meanwhile new research reveals a concerning prevalence of unwanted violent aggressive or sexual behaviours against women and girls travelling on public transport over the last five years after a survey by the suzy lamplugh trust in the absence of official statistics chronicling the scale of the problem throughout the public transport network the trust says the findings offer a strong indicator of the true scale of the problem kathleen spencer chapman head of policy advocacy and research at the childrens charity plan international uk said the findings released on national personal safety day on november were sobering these findings paint a stark picture of the relentless public sexual harassment that women and girls face sadly they confirm what we already know girls as young as are being harassed followed and touched as a result they are missing school avoiding exercise staying indoors and carrying keys between their fingers when they walk home chapman added we also know that one in six are avoiding public transport at night all to shield themselves from the constant tide of public sexual harassment indications that the home offices information campaign believed to be the first one to explicitly target perpetrators will not be ready this year has prompted disquiet a source said the reality is that it is still at concept stage and isnt in the right place at the moment saskia garner head of policy and campaigns at the suzy lamplugh trust said there was a pressing need to act but also conceded that the messaging needed to be correct there is an urgent need to address these issues that have been deprioritised for so long however the messaging needs to be right its about getting that balance garner added that it was essential the home office was consulting with organisations across the sector on the campaign but also to ensure that the voice of survivors was central she added that the campaign messaging needed to speak to the perpetrators of different crimes against women a stalker will respond very differently to certain messaging than perhaps a perpetrator of a different type of a crime because of the underlying triggers said garner a home office spokesperson said they were working to launch the campaign by the end of march next year at the latest as part of the tackling violence against women and girls strategy the government committed to launch a communications campaign this financial year that targets and challenges perpetrators of these heinous crimes and ensures victims can recognise abuse and receive support we are working closely with stakeholders including the womens sector academics and victims services and greatly appreciate the expertise insights and experience they have shared this will help deliver a campaign that provides value for money

andy a painter and decorator says he has known violence for much of his life i want a relationship but i dont know how he says i was told if you want someone else to be comfortable in your company you first have to be comfortable in your own company its hard but im trying he has been in and out of prison since he was a teenager on one occasion he was jailed when he found his then girlfriend with another man i saw red he attacked the man and bit off his ear he says she intervened i grabbed her by the throat and pushed her to get her off me she banged her head six months ago andy denied any responsibility for hurting his exgirlfriend now he says he was wrong and he shouldnt have done it denial minimisation and victim blaming have been established for more than years as the standard male perpetrators response to violence towards women on another occasion andy was recalled to prison because he cheated on a different girlfriend she confronted him and andy says attacked him no charges were brought but he was recalled it was my chaotic lifestyle always drinking always fighting he says he served another three years and acquired a drug addiction but is now clean andy has just completed an innovative week programme for men who are assessed as a moderate risk to women and have expressed a willingness to change turning the spotlight tts run by cumbria victim support also offers help for the mens families the course is skilfully led by female and male facilitators joanne nelson and richard cupid a therapist who previously worked as an engineer in barrowinfurness shipyard the men believe they should be a man which causes damage and prevents them from being themselves cupid says at the end of the programme participants are assessed on their ownership and understanding of their behaviour and why change is required the course has been massive for me andy says for the first time this month he has completed his licence in the community without recall to jail women bear so much pressure laraine carr tts coordinator says they are told to leave if they dont leave they risk their children being put into care if a couple want to make the relationship work and many do we need to make that possible if we can in a safe way data drawn up by the femicide census founded by karen ingala smith and clarrie ocallaghan covering the period found at least men killed women in the uk in the period almost half the perpetrators were known to have histories of violence against women ryan ingham killed caroline finegan in with a devastating blow he had previous convictions many for domestic abuse twentynine perpetrators had killed previously gary arthur allen killed two women years apart in and allen first strangled and inflicted injuries on samantha class including driving his car over her in alena grlakova also suffered multiple injuries the pleasure of hurting builds from the planning stage he told a probation officer prostitutes are easy targets too often we risk assess victims but not the perpetrators says campaigner ingala smith factors such as mental ill health addiction loss of status unemployment could be potential intervention points if prevention counted we know from the evidence that it doesnt femicide is not just homicide of women by men adds ocallaghan its about how and why women are killed and abused and how this is different to the circumstances in which men are killed frank mullane founder of the charity advocacy after fatal domestic abuse aafda supporting families has quality assured more than domestic homicide reviews dhrs for the home office dhrs examine the role of agencies after a death where the alleged or convicted perpetrator has mental health issues andor addiction there are too few interventions he says if we dont act early enough the conveyor belt of men who abuse and kill will keep on coming wayne couzens the killer of sarah everard unlocked the scale of largely unpunished misogyny and abuse within the police not the only institution in which perpetrators operate when it comes to reports of men killing abusing and controlling women the passive voice prevails women are assaulted women are threatened the perpetrator has disappeared says davina jameshanman a specialist for over years in the reduction of male violence against women when the victimsurvivor is the only one visible it is she who is judged blamed held accountable we need to flip the switch so that instead of why doesnt she leave we ask why doesnt he stop in england and wales three out of four domestic abuse offences reported to the police resulted in no further action convictions have dropped over five years and convictions for coercive control and rape are minuscule approximately perpetrators per year cause medium and high levels of harm yet fewer than received specialist intervention that might stop the carnage perpetrators have a passport to offend currently a myriad uncoordinated taskforces inquiries initiatives strategies and small pots of funding are flowing out of government to address male violence against women and girls this month the governments first domestic abuse strategy is published that also contains a perpetrator pillar in the budget the chancellor rishi sunak allocated m to tackle domestic abuse and rape described as a drop in the ocean jo todd founding chief executive of respect a charity that has worked with perpetrators over years says violence against women and girls costs bn a year a bn problem needs a bn solution its not just a question of funding and resources as the police refuges and charities fight deep cuts its also about a move from flawed risk management of victims and abusers to a serious investment in prevention the governments serious violence strategy does not define domestic and sexual abuse as serious violence even though it makes up of police work the police crime sentencing and courts bill contains a new serious violence prevention duty which will require a range of public bodies such the police health housing education and probation to work together in a public health framework to prevent serious violence violence against women and girls was not included in the house of lords tory peer gabrielle bertin and crossparty peers successfully included it in an amendment to the bill campaigners hope that by december the government may have made what nicole jacobs the first domestic abuse commissioner for england and wales calls an historic shift currently home secretary priti patel prefers local areas to make their own decisions about prevention strategies only half of violence reduction units set up as the forerunners of the new duty have domestic abuse and violence as part of their strategy zoe billingham was lead inspector on the polices response to domestic abuse for years at her majestys inspectorate of constabulary and fire and rescue services until her tenure came to an end in september she is now free to speak her mind as a campaigner whether its in cumbria or camden there is no excuse for such extraordinary variation in the police response to domestic abuse across the country we have to end the postcode lottery that costs womens lives she says billinghams final report on the police response to violence against women and girls published in september praised some improvements and innovations but it said that police needed clearer focus better funding a relentless pursuit of perpetrators and a sense that these are urgent national policing priorities for the report a small number of forces were each asked to identify their five highest risk perpetrators thirtyfour of the total of men identified as repeat offenders of violence against women and girls were not being tracked by the police fourteen had offended against three or more women some as many as nine over half had been offending for more than five years why havent all the forces homed in on what their intelligence is telling them and taken out these highrisk offenders asks billingham if this was organised crime you would see strongly focused covert tactics to apprehend the offender you dont see those tactics used for violence against women and girls you have to ask yourself why the report called for a statutory duty on all agencies to prevent such violence including schools health housing and social care thats the really big prize billingham says what could be better than that we need a joinedup strategy and a set of minimum standards what gets measured gets done crucially the report recommended that violence against women and girls is included in the strategic policing requirement that dictates the top priorities for all police forces in england wales along with counterterrorism serious organised crime and child sexual exploitation that signals to chief constables and police and crime commissioners the governments prioritisation the broad spectrum of crimes that disproportionately impact on women dont get anywhere near top priority billingham says if this opportunity is squandered we all lose on a wet tuesday evening in a community centre in barrowinfurness cumbria five men including andy discuss the issues they have covered during turning the spotlights previous twohour sessions they include the man box the negatives and positives of how boys are taught to be men the power wheel devised in the s which illustrates the tools men utilise including isolation intimidation physical abuse and threats to control women the red flags that trigger conflict and through role play what a healthy equal relationship might look like nelson is also lead for they matter a week cumbria victim support pilot for highrisk men mainly mandated to attend by the police and other agencies a lot of the men we see go from to like a ferrari nelson says we help to join up the dots between thinking feelings and behaviour its about being comfortable with the uncomfortable thats where the anger comes out a lot of the men are on the defensive in attack mode they say its because of how people see them but its often how they see themselves andy is now attending the sixmonth they matter programme i witnessed domestic abuse from a young age he says as a child his mother left him with his father taking andys sister his violent father was later jailed for the sexual abuse of his daughter my dad taught me that emotions are a sign of weakness he says i wasnt shown values towards women when i was five years old my dad taught me the five fs find em feel em finger em fuck em and forget em i used to sleep with women so i didnt have to be on my own now i want to have kids one day and a stable relationship ive only dipped my toe in the water of all this stuff ive got a lot to learn he says respect the charity safelives and the notforprofit social finance in set up the drive partnership a threeyear pilot programme for highrisk highharm perpetrators unwilling to change drive worked with the police and a range of agencies to disrupt perpetrators opportunities to abuse and control men who have experienced childhood trauma and who want to change we can help todd says the ones who are calculating cold and controlling and get off on it require a different response an evaluation of the impact on perpetrators and whether change was sustained over months showed significant reductions in physical and sexual abuse and jealous and controlling behaviour in another study by the university of northumbria an intervention was found to have caused a reduction in domestic and violent offending and a social return of saved for every spent but programmes are scarce and the unanswered question is does change last in england and wales only one in five women report partner abuse and one in six report sexual assault to the police police scotlands campaign dont be that guy highlights casual male sexual entitlement and underlines that its the responsibility of everyone to call out and act to end mens violence against women but that will still not be enough we are only at the edges of understanding jo todd of respect says society and every institution in it has to change otherwise the difference made will be time limited and small weve yet to see those in power really willing to take on misogyny men who harm and kill have to be held to account and assisted to change in a way that does not put women at risk ingala smith adds its not useful to hear that perpetrators had difficult upbringings if we cannot explain why women who were also damaged in childhood have not abused on the same scale and then we need to act on what we have learned some names have been changed aims of the observer end femicide campaign name it the government to formally recognise femicide

a call to action was published in january demanding a domestic abuse perpetrator strategy for england and wales police and crime commissioners academics and organisations including respect safelives and womens aid all added their signatures the report pointed out that shockingly while there were at least serious perpetrators fewer than received specialist intervention to challenge and change their behaviour so why is there so little provision as the observer reports today in the latest article in our end femicide campaign the epidemic of male violence against women and girls vawg makes up of police business yet prevention stopping perpetrators before they inflict psychological physical sexual economic and digital damage utilising social media is given a low priority convictions for domestic abuse offences have dropped in five years a woman is killed by a man every three days according to the femicide census whose data has helped to inform our campaign a terrible statistic unchanged for years zoe billingham former lead inspector on the polices response to domestic abuse at her majestys inspectorate of constabulary and fire amp rescue services says that if this was organised crime police would be using all the covert tactics at their disposal to arrest offenders according to the crime survey for england and wales in the year ending march there were an estimated million female victims of domestic abuse aged to men are victims too but women are far more likely to become victims of sexual and psychological violence data on police recorded crime based on information from forces in the year to march shows that of sexual grooming offences are against women and girls and of victims of stalking voyeurism and exposure are female this month the government will publish its first statutory domestic abuse strategy influenced by the call to action it also addresses perpetrators that is welcome if the strategy is comprehensive well funded properly evaluated and monitored and does not drain resources from victims prevention begins in early childhood to counter the toxic culture that breeds misogyny and male sexual entitlement sex and relationship education is compulsory in schools but what works best to engender respect and empathy is far from understood a teenage boy who is concerned about his behaviour will find few resources if he seeks help perpetrators are hugely diverse but missed opportunities for intervention include childhood trauma mental ill health a history of criminal behaviour and substance misuse the abhorrent actions of police officer wayne couzens killer of sarah everard have triggered several investigations into our institutions including the police and army which reveal the appalling scale of abuse of women and a shameful lack of action by those in authority bbc research revealed that uk police forces received more than allegations of domestic abuse against officers and staff in the last five years yet only were prosecuted what does that say about our culture and a shameful lack of accountability femicide and abuse wont end until misogyny is recognised for what it is and eliminated two steps would make a difference first vawg must be included in the new serious violence duty part of the police crime sentencing and courts bill which requires public bodies such as police health housing and education to work together to end violence second vawg needs to be included in the strategic policing requirement that dictates the top priorities for all police forces in england and wales along with

how can i get my young kids out the door without running late for once dentists recommend brushing childrens teeth for two minutes at a time doing my fouryearold sons can take if that sounds orally retentive on my part rest assured very few of the minutes are actually spent brushing truth be told its likely fewer than two usually there are several minutes of asking followed by a few gentle reminders several increasingly terse requests and then a melange of pleading bribery and blackmail by that stage hes at least in the bathroom approximately three seconds after the toothbrush makes contact with its targets come the questions nowhere on the toothpaste tube does it specify that fluoride stimulates curiosity in childrens brains but i can confirm the correlation i cant be mad at him of course because hes not doing anything naughty hes just being a delightfully distracted fouryearold boy with zero concept of time or what it means to be late for work i envy him if anything and dont want to impinge upon his carefree childhood outlook with my banal adult agenda it would however be nice not to start every day with a dose of frustration mixed with cortisol as we scramble to get to work not long after we had his elder sister our first i remember lamenting to a colleague at work about the early wakeup calls dont worry she said youll be screaming at them to get out the door in no time such was my naivety i thought this was a joke that she was referring to the teenage years and how they grow up so fast turns out not so much of all the least fun parenting roles to play that of the nagger is surely right up there even i hate the sound of my own voice this cuts to the central irony of parenthood an activity which expands your very understanding of love connection and purpose helping you identify whats truly important in life only to simultaneously lump you with such copious quantities of tedious shit that you soon forget all about it especially when much of the tedium

stella creasy has criticised the absurdity of parliaments approach to new mothers after the commons speaker said it was up to the chair of a debate to decide whether mps could bring in their babies creasy a labour mp who was reprimanded for bringing her baby into a westminster hall debate earlier this year criticised the position of sir lindsay hoyle the commons speaker who suggested he and his deputies should use their discretion in an interview with the daily telegraph hoyle said that it should be up to the mp chairing the debate to decide whether the presence of a baby would cause any disruption but creasy rejected this as a solution saying it would not work in practice because an mp with a baby would have to decide whether to use her proxy vote hours in advance or turn up to the debate and risk being turned away given there is no published list of who is chairing a debate and i have to give up my proxy a day in advance in order to speak there is every possibility i could turn up but find when i get to a debate that i couldnt take part because the chair wouldnt let me she said the whole thing reflects the absurdity of how parliament operates when it comes to new parents and why we need proper maternity cover for mps and an actual proper maternity policy because in any other workplace creating barriers for pregnant and new mothers would be illegal she highlighted research from delta poll that found of people thought there should be proper maternity cover for mps and of respondents thought bringing a baby into the chamber should always be acceptable or acceptable in some circumstances while stated it should never be allowed creasy had asked for clarification from commons authorities after being reprimanded for having her infant son in a sling as she spoke in parliament last month saying it had not been a problem on previous occasions commons rules state that mps should not have children or infants with them in the chamber but creasy has taken both of her children into the chamber before without any complaints being made hoyle requested a review into whether the rules should be updated and reiterated his view that the chair on the day has got to make a decision referring to creasys son he said i saw that baby come into the chamber when i was in the chair and did it affect the debate no was it a quiet and peaceful baby absolutely did it disrupt not in the slightest so did it matter to me absolutely not what i would say and ill be quite honest with you is each chair will make a decision unfortunately its become highly political it is now for others to decide thats why the committee is reviewing it and i will then have to respect its decision he also said he had asked the crossparty procedure committee to examine the rules and whether changes were needed and that he and his deputies could use their discretion in applying the existing measures the issue caused an outcry when creasy the mp for walthamstow tweeted an email she had received from commons authorities which read we have been made aware that you were accompanied by your baby in westminster hall earlier today it referred to the latest edition of the commons rulebook which says mps should not take their seats in the chamber with a child the email from the private secretary to the chairman of ways and means the formal title for the most senior deputy speaker read i would like to draw your attention to the fact that this also applies to debates in westminster hall creasy had been leading a debate about buynowpaylater consumer credit schemes in the hall a subsidiary chamber where mps can raise issues of interest to them she has repeatedly argued that mps should have proper maternity cover so that they would not have to turn up to debates in person in order to properly represent their constituents they are currently given some money for extra case workers for constituency matters but not to carry out their parliamentary work writing in the guardian about the argument she said with little support from the authorities or indeed my own political party i have worked as best i can while managing the needs of my now weekold son thats why i was baffled to be told i could not take him into parliament with me it doesnt have to be like this whether in new zealand canada or in europe parliaments around the world have shown a familyfriendly legislature is possible there are thousands of mothers out there who have something valuable to add to our politics and they want to run for now they see the mother of all parliaments discouraging mothers and rightly wonder if they will be welcome,2021-12,stella creasy ha criticised absurdity parliament approach new mother common speaker said wa chair debate decide whether mp could bring baby creasy labour

the country has undergone massive cultural change around violence against women in the past year but the government is still failing completely to recognise the scale of the problem according to labour mp jess phillips i do feel like for the first time in my life violence against women and girls is definitely going to have to be a political priority and they cannot forget it she told the guardian but even with all the cultural change the conversations the money apparently being thrown at it im still left despairing with women whove got nothing out the system and its just failed them again and again and are women safer now than they were at the start of the year no theyre not phillips the shadow domestic violence minister has long campaigned on issues surrounding violence against women and each year in parliament reads out the names of all the women who have been killed by men in the preceding months this year had marked a huge shift change in awareness of the issue she said i used to wait for karen ingala smith from counting dead women to send me the names but i see them all myself now theyre being reported everywhere she said and finally its not just like arent these individual cases bad we have started as a public to see them in the round the murder of sarah everard by the police officer wayne couzens in march sparked a nationwide conversation around womens safety that has been galvanised by further killings including sabina nessa who was found dead in a london park in september and gracie spinks who was killed by a stalker in june andrea simon head of the end violence against women coalition said efforts to further protect women in had not gone far enough it has been an unprecedented year in terms of how much were talking about violence against women and girls which means that for many it feels like a watershed moment she said however i think many of the solutions and the responses from government and in the criminal justice system have missed the mark we havent gone as far as we should have done and we havent moved as quickly in terms of making things better for women and girls who report abuse phillips said that while the government has claimed to be taking action on the issue its not ok to focus this entirely on the criminal justice system theyre still stuck in a furrow of tough on crime i will respond to their tough on crime by saying youre not being tough on crime youre literally letting most rapists through to effectively tackle the problem there needed to be institutional change across a wide range of services she said particularly in housing and welfare in england there isnt anywhere a single woman on an average wage could afford a private rental property and we ask ourselves why women end up stuck she said but the government think that declaring new sentences is the answer the government is also failing to dedicate enough resources to prevention she said there needs to be far more about education far more about what behaviours are and arent acceptable there needs to be far more robust interruption of the perpetrator whereas currently the system relies on the interruption of the victim reflecting back on the year phillips said she felt a little bit beaten after speaking out about so many distressing cases i have found it a really difficult year you get to the point where each and every case that i see i cant believe that its still so bad and it feels tiring it feels tiring she said and i have suffered more because of the raised profile and the threat level against me has gone up as a result of me speaking out about it in april tony eckersley a white supremacist was jailed for more than two years after sending hundreds of violent misogynistic and racist messages to phillips she said the online harms bill currently making its way through parliament must be used as an opportunity to protect women online but currently it doesnt say women in it once so theres work to do she said phillips said she was hopeful for the future with more opportunities to help tackle issues around violence against women than ever before but she still despaired at how much preventive work women were expected to do themselves women are the ones passing on the stories to their daughters about what you have to do theres a dreadful batonpassing about what to expect in life she said women are the ones who have to act differently have to behave differently were supposed to flag down the buses women in relationships are meant to risk assess and then if you are a victim of violence that is like a fulltime job to come forward about it there is just so much where we are expected to fill the gaps left by a system that has failed,2021-12,country ha undergone massive cultural change around violence

fantasy and realty but in our house we happily confuse the two all the time for months last year when we were making our way through laura ingalls wilders little house on the prairie series my kindergartner would stride around the apartment in a full pioneer girls getup complete with bonnet asking me how best to break the oxen or till the land she committed deeply to the role cut from the same cloth as jeremy strong and other method actors insisting her pajamas were made of calico and roasting in the dress throughout the summer even as she pretended a blizzard was swirling outside and she could see her breath in the air you want some ice cream this my preschooler asks from various perches as her imaginary ice cream stand roams the living room the sadistic vendor offering flavors that are often suddenly sold out on rare occasions shell morph into a doctor offering shots with her scoops though shes highly specialized treating but one ailment jumping so high on the trampoline that you hurt your arm its some botched version of what happened to her older sister who fractured her elbow last year after a fall from some monkey bars but remains seared in her mind as something very bad that can be fixed with a quick injection and in the last few weeks her pretend play has gotten even more intense with nightly demands for trampoline accident related bedtime stories at two and a half three years old the fuzziness between reality and fantasy is blurred kathy hirshpasek told me when i reached her by phone and i think fantasy is very powerful for kids its a safe place hirshpasek is a professor of psychology at temple university where she studies child development and a senior fellow at the brookings institution i called her in the hopes that she could put my childrens ampedup pretend play into the context of our chaotic year was it a plea for help an indication that our new normal with its constantly moving lines in the sand you can see nana and papa indoors but with masks or maybe only outside but at a distance heres a zoom kit sent home from school before winter break which we may have to use but probably not was taking its toll when hirshpaseks children were in that liminal realityfantasy age she told me there were real monsters in their closet so we did a whole ceremony with dream catchers we turned the mattress around we grabbed the monsters and threw them down the toilet she remembered we were letting the kids know that they have the power to control something even if they dont its a really powerful message and it may be particularly important now when children however sheltered from the specifics of this rolling uncertainty are internalizing more than we know they pick up on every little thing we do they model it they understand it they watch us like they are sociologists hirshpasek said and weve been a wreck i may not be wearing a calico dress and doling out shots for hyperspecific trampoline accidents but havent we all been living a little bit in fantasy land over the past year and a half every time i make and then cancel dinner plans every time i convince myself that by this or that date i wont have to affix a tiny surgical mask on to my pintsized urban doctor and send her off to preschool every night i think ill forego that handful or three of leftover halloween candy to take the edge off its all fantasy but for a few moments i live in that safe space kids just do it for way longer finding real comfort in their imagination the kindergartner and i just finished reading the bfg which i found to be both a particularly enjoyable way to suspend reality but also a wonderful allegory for parenting during the pandemic for the four people out there who have not yet read this roald dahl classic spoilers ahead its about a big friendly giant and an orphan sophie who catches sight of him one dark night from the orphanage window as hes blowing something into a childs room across the way he sees her looking scoops her up and whisks her off to giant country where she learns that while the bfg catches dreams and blows them into childrens rooms at night there are other evil giants who roam the world snatching people from their beds and eating them the plot turns when sophie and the bfg decide to do something about it in the end the bad giants get captured and as in so much of dahls fiction the child triumphs its offering a way to say yeah there are some monsters out there but guess what we have the power to deal with them hirshpasek told me fantasy can make things that are scary not so scary help kids cope just a little bit better and show them that with us they have the power to change anything she paused maybe thats not honest i get that but im down with fantasy she later sent me a study concluding that young children often learn realworld information better if its presented in a fantastical story that violates real world paradigms the other night hoping to prolong my nightly escapes with dahl i looked up the name on the bfgs inscription page olivia a quick google search heaved the moment on its axis refocusing everything like a hitchcockian dolly zoom shot olivia was dahls daughter who died suddenly in at age seven of encephalitis brought on by the measles as the illness took its usual course i can remember reading to her often in bed and not feeling particularly alarmed about it he wrote in a widely distributed open letter urging parents to vaccinate their children published during a measles outbreak in then one morning when she was well on the road to recovery i was sitting on her bed showing her how to fashion little animals out of coloured pipecleaners and when it came to her turn to make one herself i noticed that her fingers and her mind were not working together in an hour she was unconscious in twelve hours she was dead he dedicated james and the giant peach to olivia when she was still alive twenty years after her death he published the bfg with her name at its front as dahl knew so well in fantasy you can do anything make rivers of chocolate fly inside giant peaches even bring daughters back to life the conceit of the book which you learn in the last few pages is that the bfg actually wrote the thing and just published it under another name the night we finished my kindergartner looked at the cover for a while i dont think thats actually true she said my heart sank imagining her passing over that invisible boundary from fantasybeliever to hardened realist a transition i feared might be accelerated by the last few years then as she closed her eyes and started to drift off she mumbled i think what actually happened is that sophie told the story to roald dahl and he wrote it down and of course in a way shes right sophie

after the murder of sarah everard by a serving police officer earlier this year a dam burst women came out on to the streets of britain to protest against male violence only to be met with police violence that dam is still flooding at least women in the uk have died at the hands of a man in so far countless more will have taken their own lives as a consequence of male violence women are tired of reading the names of the women killed by femicide each year they are tired of reading about the increase in the reports of sexual violence and domestic violence and they are tired of the failure of the criminal justice system to tackle the problem as the virtual collapse of rape prosecutions over the past three years shows but perhaps for the first time in living memory tackling the pandemic of violence against women and girls vawg is high on the political agenda i have been working in this area since the s as a lawyer and founder of the centre for womens justice cwj which aims to change the structural disadvantage women and girls face across the criminal justice system in the past five years alone i have represented survivors of the serial rapist john worboys in their action against the metropolitan police which failed to investigate him represented sally challen and other women who killed abusive partners and am currently involved in a super complaint about the failure to address policeperpetrated domestic abuse however in my experience the attitudes of prosecutors and judges towards women are as bad as ever while initial announcements from the government were kneejerk and ill thought through such as undercover police officers in nightclubs or apps to track womens routes home there may be substantial changes coming this month the government announced legislation that will put a new legal duty on local public bodies to tackle domestic abuse and sexual offences and has just announced plans for a new victims law meanwhile there is growing pressure to make vawg part of the strategic policing requirement which would bring it in line with other serious crimes such as organised crime and terrorism increasing the resources of police and other criminal justice agencies and making the tackling of vawg a national strategic priority would certainly go some way to reversing the impact of austerity a decade of underfunding has brought the criminal court system to its knees with fewer specialist policing units a dismantled probation service fewer support services for women and significant reductions in legal aid however the comparison with the policing of terrorism may strike a chilling chord for black asian and minority women and men who have been adversely affected by the governments prevent strategy aimed at identifying and disrupting potential recruits to terrorism which has helped mainstream discrimination against them such cynicism about government intentions is further embedded by the discriminatory exclusion of migrant women from the protections offered in the recent domestic abuse bill the attack on the right to public protest in the police crime and sentencing bill and the curtailing of routes to refugee status for women fleeing abuse under the nationality and borders bill in october the home secretary priti patel announced a public inquiry into issues raised by the conviction of wayne couzens this could be an opportunity to undertake a deep searching analysis of institutionalised misogyny within policing however the governments resistance to putting the inquiry on a statutory footing suggests the prime ministers promise to fix things in the wake of everards murder is not a serious one so i am working with the backing of more than national womens organisations to formally bring judicial review proceedings against the home secretary to ensure this inquiry is the robust investigation into policeperpetrated abuse and violence against women that is so desperately needed so what does need to change if we are to begin to tackle the spectacular failings not only in policing but across the criminal justice system it is a question i am asked frequently instead of waiting for a public inquiry to provide answers the cwj has set out its own manifesto for change the central principle of this manifesto is that women have a right to live free from the fear of male violence which curtails our liberty and undermines our full participation in society we do not propose new laws in our manifesto but rather we ask for the urgent and effective implementation of the laws that already exist we ask that those investigating and prosecuting crimes of violence against women those who judge and sentence and those who manage the risk of individuals convicted act with the united aim and understanding of how to prevent further violence we want radical transformation of the investigation and prosecution of crimes of vawg an end to victim blaming policeperpetrated abuse tackled and an understanding of who represents risk to ensure criminal justice interventions are directed at the perpetrators and not the victim how might this work take the example of effie not her real name a migrant woman we are advising whose british partner who had been physically and psychologically abusive towards her for months called the police to their home alleging she had physically injured him during an argument at the time of this call safeguarding concerns had already been raised by agencies who recognised she was at high risk of harm from her partner yet instead of investigating who the primary perpetrator in the relationship was the police arrested effie and imposed strict bail conditions which rendered her homeless and separated her from her breastfeeding child she was convicted of assault which we successfully appealed in another example a parole board considering the release of a man widely reported to have drugged and sexually assaulted more than women might ask itself whether to accept his account that he no longer represented a threat this is exactly what happened with the case of worboys his release after just years in prison was only stopped after i submitted a judicial review challenge on behalf of two of his victims then there is the case of sophie moss a vulnerable mother of two who died as a result of prolonged pressure to the neck at the hands of sam pybus he was given just four years and eight months after the crown prosecution service accepted his plea of manslaughter pybus claimed she enjoyed erotic asphyxiation more commonly known as the rough sex defence which is creeping in to murder cases under our manifesto a prosecutor may have questioned the idea that moss enjoyed being strangled during sex on the say so of the man who killed her and another man who had had sex with her and should have put other evidence before a jury for example from the father of mosss children which disputed the assertion she liked to be strangled our manifesto recognises that all of this must happen within the framework of cultural change as mina smallman the mother of the two murdered sisters bibaa henry and nicole smallman whose bodies were photographed and shared on a police whatsapp group said this week those police officers felt so safe so untouchable that they felt they would take photographs with our murdered daughters she added there is more work to be done we are part of the change thats going to come in the culture of the police force only when there is an understanding of the structural inequalities between men and women and the intersecting forms of discrimination that make some groups of women more vulnerable based on race class and disability will real change occur in the meantime we will keep fighting this article was amended on december to clarify a reference to the sophie moss case an earlier version said sam pybus was given just four years and eight months for manslaughter after the cps accepted his explanation that she enjoyed erotic asphyxiation the cps says it did not accept the defendants account but brought a manslaughter charge due to insufficient evidence of intent to harm or kill harriet wistrich is a solicitor and the director of the centre

my son is inconsolable his jaw clenched fists tight like little doughballs were late leaving for nursery and hes extremely upset the kind of upset which usually id remedy by simply giving him whatever he wanted so we can be on our way unfortunately as happens more frequently these days the thing he wants does not exist tomaaaaaato yoghurt he screams for the th time i want some tomaaaaato yoghurt i tell him he cant have tomato yoghurt and for the following reasons first to the best of my knowledge tomato yoghurt is not something that exists and is certainly not something to which he has become sufficiently acquainted that its denial should be provoking such a reaction furthermore if tomato yoghurt did exist id be willing to bet folding money that it would not find itself within the of foodstuffs he actually likes since he has never really enjoyed tomato in the first place and finally hes already had a very sizeable breakfast of foods that a he likes and b have previously been recorded in the history of human civilisation as usual my words have no effect and he remains both literally and figuratively unmoved he stands there welded to the spot crying tears of rage as if i his doting father am refusing him water or insulin to some extent this is better than those times i had to stop him from consuming actual existing things around the house toilet water and the soil from our plant pots but in other ways its worse when he asks for something hes not allowed to have i know how to talk him down but when he asks for entirely impossible things its hard to know what to do it was the same with his weeklong obsession with aeroplane bagels a foodstuff we think he may have experienced in a dream and which bears so little resemblance to standard shopbought bagels that he felt forced to scream screamed in our faces any time they were offered in consolation as always i have to remind myself that hes three and therefore doesnt know that theres no such thing as tomato yoghurt or aeroplane bagels or milk burgers or paint pies but i cant help being appalled by the strength of his futile conviction its stressful and confusing to see him reduced to furious sobs at the thought of illogical horrible food combinations like a tired confused heston blumenthal scrolling dejectedly through his drafts folder at nursery he runs into the arms of his carers with delight as if finally freed from his growling dictator of a father on the way home i google tomato yoghurt and find one japanese stockist who bill it somewhat winningly as the tomato yoghurt that makes tomato haters faint in agony i manage to resist the urge to buy it just to know what is in my sons head or if im honest so we can feed it to him and have him admit his folly instead i show it to my wife who says huh thats funny i was just telling him the other day that tomatoes were a fruit how wonderful i say clenching my own jaw youre doing breakfast next time did ye hear mammy died by samas oreilly is
