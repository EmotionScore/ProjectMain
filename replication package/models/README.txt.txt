DATA AND MODEL FILES

Due to GitHub file size limitations, the original dataset and trained model files are NOT included in this repository.

ACCESSING THE DATA

All necessary data and model files can be downloaded from the original authors' Zenodo repository:

https://zenodo.org/record/5748084

LOCAL SETUP

All team members are expected to have the data and models stored locally on their own machines.

IMPORTANT: Please keep the files in the original folder structure to avoid need to manually change file paths in code.
